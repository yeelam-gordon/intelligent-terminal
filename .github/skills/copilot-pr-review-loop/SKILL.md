# Copilot PR Review Loop

Drive any GitHub pull request through repeated rounds of Copilot code
review until the agent has done its job — every Copilot finding has
a reply from the agent (fix-acknowledgement, decline-with-rationale,
or explicit escalate-to-user hand-off). Remaining open threads, if
any, are deliberate hand-offs to the human merge owner — they're
not loop failures. Repository-agnostic — works on any repo that has
Copilot Code Review enabled, run from a machine with `gh` CLI
installed and authenticated (see Prerequisites).

## When to Use This Skill

- The user asks to "request Copilot review" or "run a Copilot review loop"
  on a PR.
- A PR is functionally complete and the user wants a final correctness pass
  via repeated automated review rounds.
- A previous Copilot review on the PR has left open threads that need
  triage, fixing, replying, and resolving.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- The PR is still under active design — wait until the structure is stable;
  otherwise findings churn round-over-round.
- The user wants human reviewer feedback, not Copilot's.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated against the target repository.
- PowerShell on PATH — Windows PowerShell 5.1+ (`powershell.exe`) or
  PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`). Both are tested.
- Copilot Code Review is the primary use case (`01-request-review.ps1`
  uses GraphQL `requestReviewsByLogin` to trigger Copilot). It is
  **NOT a hard requirement** — if `01-request-review.ps1` fails
  because Copilot isn't enabled on the repo / account, the agent can
  still drive existing review threads (human, advanced-security, etc.)
  to completion by running steps 3–8 once as a single iteration; just
  skip the trigger + wait. There is no auto-detect for "Copilot
  unavailable" — the agent makes that decision after the trigger
  fails (the script can't reliably tell "Copilot disabled" from
  "Copilot enabled but not yet triggered" from API state alone).

Every script dot-sources [scripts/_lib.ps1](scripts/_lib.ps1) which
runs `Assert-GhReady` on load: if `gh` is missing OR `gh auth status`
fails, the script halts **before any work** with a single actionable
error message naming the install command and `gh auth login`. The
agent should surface that message to the user verbatim and stop the
loop — do not retry or work around it.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

Each round runs steps 1–9; step 10 is a one-time cleanup after
convergence. The parent agent coordinates; every substantive step is
delegated to a fresh sub-agent with a bounded budget (default ≤5 min;
per-step exceptions in the delegation table in
[references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md)), so the parent
never blocks on long-running work and each step gets a clean context.
Sub-agents must summarize and return before their budget expires; the
parent extends via `write_agent` when needed. Full procedure,
per-step budgets, return contracts, and the extension protocol live
in [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md).

**Single-iteration fallback (Copilot unavailable)**: when
`01-request-review.ps1` throws because Copilot Code Review isn't
enabled on the repo / account (the GraphQL mutation reports the bot
isn't a valid reviewer), the agent skips step 2 and runs steps 3–8
once, then calls `02-check-review-status.ps1 -SingleIteration` for
the convergence check (which then ignores the stale-review checks
that can't advance without a new Copilot review). `Converged: true`
when `OpenThreadsAwaitingReply == 0`. Re-iteration happens only when
a human posts new comments later — re-run the skill at that point.

```
Request review → Wait for review (sub-agent) → List + categorize open
threads → Triage (sub-agent) → Fix (sub-agents, parallel) → Build/test
per the repo's own conventions → Commit + push → Reply + resolve
(citing pushed SHA) → Convergence check → Cleanup outdated (final, once)
```

**Build, test, and lint commands are NOT prescribed here.** Each
step that runs them defers to the target repo's own conventions —
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README`, `package.json`/`Makefile`/
language-specific tooling, or whatever the repo uses. The skill's job
is the review loop; the repo's job is to tell us how it's built.

Convergence is computed by [scripts/02-check-review-status.ps1](scripts/02-check-review-status.ps1)
as a single `Converged: true` boolean. Do **not** call `task_complete`
until it returns true; print the proof (`HeadOid`,
`LatestCopilotReview.commitOid`, `submittedAt`) in the completion
message.

## Gotchas

- **NEVER post `@copilot please review` (or any `@copilot` mention)
  as a PR comment** to trigger a code review. That summons the Copilot
  **Coding Agent** (which makes commits), not the reviewer bot, and
  will not produce a review. Use [scripts/01-request-review.ps1](scripts/01-request-review.ps1)
  (GraphQL `requestReviewsByLogin`); if it can't land the trigger,
  push a substantive commit (auto-assign on `synchronize` is the most
  reliable fallback) — never fall back to `@`-mentions.
- **HTTP 200 / exit 0 from the trigger call is NOT proof Copilot
  accepted it.** The server can silently drop a request (quiet-period
  after dismissal, trivial-diff suppression, repo without Copilot
  enabled). The authoritative signal is a `copilot_work_started`
  event on the issue (via `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/events`)
  newer than your request.
  `01-request-review.ps1` enforces this via event-`id` comparison —
  don't weaken it.
- **A "no new comments" review is necessary but not sufficient for
  convergence.** It must ALSO be at the current `HEAD` SHA AND every
  open thread must have a reply from the agent
  (`OpenThreadsAwaitingReply == 0`). A stale review on an earlier
  commit lets a regression slip through unreviewed; an open Copilot
  thread the agent hasn't replied to means the loop hasn't done its
  job yet. `02-check-review-status.ps1`'s `Converged` flag enforces
  all three. Open threads with our reply (escalate-to-user
  hand-offs, contested declines) are by design — they're awaiting
  the human merge owner, not the loop.
- **Reply to every open thread; resolve only when the loop owns the
  disposition** (`fix` or `decline`). For threads classified
  `escalate-to-user`, reply with the analysis but leave the thread
  OPEN (use `08-reply-and-resolve.ps1 -NoResolve`) so the human
  merge owner can act on it. Resolving without a reply leaves no
  record of why the issue was considered addressed; resolving an
  escalated thread hides the hand-off from the human.
- **Copilot threads are loop-owned; human / advanced-security /
  other-bot
  threads default to escalate-to-user.** Auto-replying or auto-
  resolving a human review thread can hide unaddressed concerns and
  is socially wrong. The triage rubric explicitly distinguishes
  reviewer types.
- **One focused commit per round, not one per PR.** Bundling rounds
  destroys the audit trail of which finding drove which change and
  breaks `git bisect`.
- **Build/test/lint with the repo's own commands** (per its
  `CONTRIBUTING`/`AGENTS`/`README`) before pushing a fix. A broken
  build wastes the next full review cycle (3–10 minutes).
- **Research the repo's own docs before generating any fix, build,
  or test command.** Read `.github/instructions/*.md` (often with
  `applyTo` globs pinning them to specific files), `.github/skills/`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and recent commits to similar
  files. Fan out multiple sub-agents in parallel when several axes
  need checking. Never invent generic answers that contradict repo
  practice — that's the "elephant in school" anti-pattern.
- **Don't poll the review state faster than ~3 minutes.** There is
  no progress signal; faster polling only wastes API budget.
- **Respect repo-specific spell-check / lint / format policies.**
  Some repos prefer rewording over allowlist entries; some have a
  patterns/regex file; some accept inline-ignore directives. Inspect
  the repo's existing config and recent commits before applying a
  generic Copilot suggestion.
- **Push back with written rationale** when a Copilot finding would
  over-engineer the design for a hypothetical edge case. Auto-accepting
  every suggestion erodes the design.
- **Scripting traps** (`gh api graphql -F` type-coercion, `git stash
  push -m` positional parsing, the three GraphQL traps for the
  reviewer mutation) are documented in
  [references/api-quirks.md](references/api-quirks.md). Read before
  modifying any script.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Script throws `prerequisite missing — gh CLI is not on PATH` | Install `gh` (`winget install GitHub.cli` on Windows; `brew install gh` on macOS; package manager on Linux; or download from https://cli.github.com). Then `gh auth login`. Surface the message to the user and STOP the loop — do not retry. |
| Script throws `prerequisite missing — gh CLI is not authenticated` | Run `gh auth login`. STOP the loop until the user completes auth. |
| Trigger fails or no `copilot_work_started` event lands | Push a substantive (non-whitespace) commit — auto-assign on `synchronize` is the most reliable trigger. Persistent failure indicates Copilot Code Review may not be enabled on the repo / account (check repo Settings → Code & automation → Copilot, or account-level Copilot Pro/Pro+). |
| No new review after waiting ~10 min | Quiet-period after recent dismissal or trivial-diff suppression. Push a substantive commit and retry. Do not blindly re-run `01-request-review.ps1` — it reports `InFlight` while Copilot is still a requested reviewer. |
| Outdated-but-unresolved threads in the open list | Expected: unresolved state is the source of truth. Reply + resolve them like any other open thread. `10-cleanup-outdated.ps1` is only a final safety net. |
| Unsure whether to fix or decline a finding | See [references/03-triage-criteria.md](references/03-triage-criteria.md). |
| Need a reply phrasing for "fixed", "declined", or "drift" | See [references/06-reply-templates.md](references/06-reply-templates.md). |
