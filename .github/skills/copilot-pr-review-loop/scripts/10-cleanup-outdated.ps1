.SYNOPSIS
    Batch-resolve outdated Copilot review threads on a PR.

.DESCRIPTION
    After a review loop converges, the PR may still show old `isOutdated`
    Copilot threads listed as open. They were addressed by later commits
    but never explicitly resolved. This script finds them and resolves them
    in bulk.

    Only acts on threads where:
      - isOutdated: true
      - isResolved: false
      - the first comment's author is copilot-pull-request-reviewer

    Threads from human reviewers are never touched.

.PARAMETER Owner
    Repository owner (org or user). Defaults to the current repo's owner
    (resolved via `gh repo view`).

.PARAMETER Repo
    Repository name. Defaults to the current repo's name.

.PARAMETER PrNumber
    The pull request number.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh 10-cleanup-outdated.ps1 -PrNumber 122

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh 10-cleanup-outdated.ps1 -PrNumber 122 -DryRun
