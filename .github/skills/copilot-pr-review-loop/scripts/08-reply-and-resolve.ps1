.SYNOPSIS
    Post a reply on a Copilot review thread and resolve it.

.DESCRIPTION
    Performs the two GraphQL mutations needed to address a Copilot finding:
    1. addPullRequestReviewThreadReply — appends a reply comment.
    2. resolveReviewThread             — marks the thread resolved.

    Use this for both accepted-and-fixed findings and for declined-with-
    rationale findings. See ../references/06-reply-templates.md for body
    patterns.

.PARAMETER ThreadId
    The GraphQL node ID of the review thread (e.g. PRRT_kw...).

.PARAMETER Body
    The reply body. Markdown is supported.

.PARAMETER NoResolve
    If set, posts the reply only and leaves the thread open. Useful when
    you want to start a back-and-forth discussion rather than close out the
    thread.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh 08-reply-and-resolve.ps1 -ThreadId PRRT_kw... -Body "Fixed in abc1234."

.EXAMPLE
    # Decline with rationale, do not resolve yet
    pwsh 08-reply-and-resolve.ps1 -ThreadId PRRT_kw... -NoResolve `
        -Body "Declining: this would require cross-class plumbing for a hypothetical race."
