.SYNOPSIS
    Snapshot the current Copilot review state of a PR. Single-shot, no waiting.

.DESCRIPTION
    ONE job: return a JSON snapshot of the PR's current Copilot
    review state. The agent (caller) decides what to do with it —
    including how long to wait between snapshots when polling for a
    new review to land. THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT WAIT.

    Output JSON fields:
      - PrNumber, Owner, Repo
      - HeadOid           : current PR HEAD SHA
      - State             : PR state (OPEN/CLOSED/MERGED)
      - LatestCopilotReview: {state, submittedAt, commitOid, bodyHead}
                            or null if no Copilot review is present
                            in the most recent 100 reviews (very long
                            PRs may have an older Copilot review outside
                            this window — treat null as "no recent
                            review", not "never reviewed")
      - ReviewAtHead       : true iff latest Copilot review's commit.oid == HeadOid
      - NoNewComments      : true iff the latest Copilot review carries zero
                             inline comments. Taken from the API's
                             `comments.totalCount`, so it does not depend on
                             how Copilot words its summary. Falls back to a
                             narrow prose match only if the count is absent.
      - OpenThreadCount    : number of unresolved review threads (from all
                             reviewers); informational — convergence does
                             NOT require this to be zero
      - OpenThreadsAwaitingReply: number of open threads where the
                             LAST comment is NOT from the authenticated
                             user (`gh api user`). "Ball-in-court"
                             model: a Copilot/human comment with no
                             reply from us OR a re-raise after our
                             earlier reply both count as awaiting. A
                             thread where WE are the latest commenter
                             counts as "done from our side" (the human
                             merge owner decides next).
      - CopilotPending     : true iff the Copilot reviewer bot is currently
                             listed in `requested_reviewers` on the PR (a
                             review is in flight; the caller should wait
                             rather than re-trigger)
      - Converged          : true iff the agent has done its job.
                             - When a Copilot review is at HEAD:
                               ReviewAtHead && NoNewComments &&
                               OpenThreadsAwaitingReply == 0.
                             - When no Copilot review has been observed
                               on this PR (LatestCopilotReview is null
                               AND CopilotPending is false): just
                               OpenThreadsAwaitingReply == 0. Note this
                               ALSO fires for a brand-new PR with zero
                               threads — meaning "nothing to do yet";
                               the agent should still trigger a Copilot
                               review via 01-request-review.ps1 if
                               Copilot is enabled on the repo. Single-
                               iteration mode (skip the trigger) is the
                               agent's decision after 01 fails with a
                               specific Copilot-disabled error, NOT an
                               auto-detected state from this script.
                             Open threads may remain in either case —
                             those are explicit hand-offs to the human
                             merge owner.

    Canonical agent loop (workflow.md):
      1. Call this script → capture LatestCopilotReview.submittedAt as
         baseline AND read CopilotPending.
      2. If CopilotPending is true, skip the trigger step — Copilot is
         already reviewing. Otherwise, call 01-request-review.ps1.
         If 01 throws with a Copilot-disabled error (e.g. the bot
         isn't a valid reviewer on this repo), the agent may fall
         back to single-iteration mode: skip the wait, jump to
         03-list-open-threads.ps1, triage + reply to whatever exists,
         done.
      3. Wait sub-agent polls this script until either submittedAt
         advances past baseline AND ReviewAtHead is true, OR Converged.
      4. On convergence end the loop; otherwise fetch threads via
         03-list-open-threads.ps1, triage, fix, push, reply, repeat.

    Parsing the JSON: timestamps are emitted as plain ISO-8601 UTC
    strings (e.g. `"2026-06-08T02:02:44Z"`). Extract via regex on the
    raw JSON to avoid PowerShell's auto re-binding of ISO strings to
    `[datetime]` (which renders local culture on string interpolation
    and silently breaks lexicographic baseline compares):

        $snap = pwsh -NoProfile -File 02-check-review-status.ps1 -PrNumber <n>
        $baseline       = if ($snap -match '"submittedAt":"([^"]+)"')  { $Matches[1] } else { '' }
        $copilotPending = ($snap -match '"CopilotPending":true')
        $converged      = ($snap -match '"Converged":true')

    Works on any PowerShell version (5.1 + 7.x). No `[datetime]`
    rebinding, no version-specific parameters.
