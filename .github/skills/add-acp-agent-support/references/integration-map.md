# ACP Agent Integration Map

Use this map as a search guide, not a promise that filenames or symbols never
change. Search for all current built-in IDs before editing and follow the
nearest current implementation.

## Capability Matrix

Record these facts before implementation:

| Field | Evidence required |
|-------|-------------------|
| Canonical ID and display name | Stable lowercase ID and official product name |
| Executable and search order | Canonical ID, interactive CLI, and ACP server may differ; record native Windows and WSL executables separately |
| ACP ownership | Native CLI or named adapter package/repository |
| Exact ACP command | Long-running stdio command, including required subcommand/flags |
| ACP version behavior | Tested CLI/adapter version and protocol initialization result |
| Authentication | ACP in-protocol method or exact external login/logout/status commands |
| ACP model selection | ACP model API and/or server-start flags |
| Delegate command | Interactive initial-prompt syntax, model syntax, and argument order |
| Resume/new session | Exact flag/subcommand and identifier semantics, or unsupported |
| Session hooks | Official hook/plugin API, lifecycle events, install location, ACP-mode suppression, or unsupported |
| Installation | Official package ID/command and documentation URL |
| Branding | Official SVG source and license/usage terms |
| Known limitations | Hooks, history, source/platform coverage, models, auth refresh, or delegate omissions |

Do not infer capabilities from another agent. Exercise the installed CLI's
help and ACP behavior directly.

An agent can ship a standalone ACP executable independently of its interactive
CLI. Detect the executable required by the selected ACP source, not merely the
provider ID or presence of the ordinary CLI.
When the native archive includes required companion executables, validate the
complete selected installation, not just the server filename. Preserve PATH
precedence and distinguish native WSL targets from Windows-interoperability links.
Preserve platform-specific arguments without duplicating authentication/session/protocol
handling for Windows and Linux.
Use the existing host/WSL source abstraction and never silently fall back to the host.
Validate explicit WSL metadata at the shared wire boundary as well as at launch
sinks. Missing or malformed distro names must reject helper/master startup,
not become a host agent selection. Retain legacy absent/host source behavior.

## WTA (Rust)

### `tools/wta/src/agent_registry.rs`

Add an `AgentProfile` and update tests for:

- canonical ID and display name;
- executable resolution;
- native ACP flags or full adapter launch command;
- ACP-specific versus delegate model flags;
- `AcpAuthFlow`;
- delegate prompt shape;
- install and auth guidance;
- resume and caller-chosen session ID support.

Also inspect command-to-agent identification, adapter aliases, known-ID tests,
and default/fallback behavior. If the new CLI needs a prompt shape the registry
cannot represent, extend the type generically and test existing agents for
regressions rather than hardcoding a one-off branch.

### `tools/wta/src/agent_check.rs`

Add the exact external login command only when external auth is real. Check
whether enterprise-host arguments are agent-specific and must be ignored.
Test login command generation.

### Session management

If the agent supports ACP `session/list`, ACP `session/load`, or an interactive
CLI resume command, wire its canonical ID through the complete session
subsystem. Updating `AgentProfile.resume_flag` alone is insufficient.

Search for every exhaustive `CliSource` match and update the applicable
surfaces:

- `agent_sessions.rs`: add the typed variant plus `parse` and `from_agent_id`;
- `app.rs`: map the typed source back to the canonical ID so resume capability
  checks and `<cli> <resume flag> <session id>` synthesis work;
- `session_registry.rs`: preserve the source through helper/master wire
  serialization instead of degrading it to `Unknown`;
- `session_history.rs`, `main.rs`, and `ui/agents_view.rs`: keep diagnostic and
  UI labels exhaustive;
- `master/mod.rs` and its listing/cache helpers: add source-aware ACP session
  discovery only when the server actually supports `session/list`.
- `session_mgmt.rs` and dispatch callers: distinguish ACP-owned sessions from
  ordinary CLI history, and preserve the selected source when resuming.

Agent history also activates sessions through master's `handle_session_activate`,
not just the helper's picker. Both paths must use the same capability metadata,
actual CLI executable, source/cwd validation and resume bindings. Keep origin
indexing and row identity qualified by provider and execution source so equal raw
session IDs cannot hide or activate a different provider's history.

Add regression tests for ID parsing, wire round-trips, current-agent filtering,
resume dispatch, and the exact CLI resume command. For CLI resume tabs, pass the
stored session title to `wtcli new-tab`; do not force suppression of later
application-title updates unless the product explicitly requires a fixed title.

Prove whether native ACP and ordinary CLI sessions share storage and identifiers.
Working `session/load` and CLI resume APIs do not establish cross-interface
compatibility. When their stores differ, choose resume by session origin and
execution source rather than merely by the presence of a CLI resume flag.

The characteristic missed-mapping failure is:

```text
Cannot resume session <id>: its source agent is unknown to this build.
```

When this appears, inspect the helper log's
`activate_agent_session_routed` entry. A known built-in showing
`cli=Unknown("custom")` means a session conversion boundary is missing.

### `tools/wta/src/coordinator.rs`

Delegate support must preserve:

- executable and base arguments;
- model argument placement;
- interactive initial-prompt placement;
- multiline prompt integrity;
- quoting for direct Windows, pwsh, Windows PowerShell, and WSL;
- clear rejection of empty or invalid executable command lines.

Add assertions for the complete command shape, not merely the presence of the
agent name.

### `tools/wta/src/main.rs` and ACP modules

Update user-facing supported-agent lists and inspect ACP initialization,
authentication, model selection, and probing for agent-specific assumptions.
Do not add protocol special cases when profile metadata or ACP capabilities can
drive the behavior.

### First-user authentication

An `InProtocol` profile is not proof of working onboarding. Test an uninitialized
provider authentication context through the normal Agent pane:

- retain the advertised `authMethods` for the exact provider/source;
- expose a real sign-in action and let the user select the advertised method;
- issue standard ACP `authenticate` on the same master-owned provider process,
  keeping stdin and the browser callback alive until completion;
- distinguish authorization waiting, cancellation, timeout, provider rejection,
  and authenticated session creation;
- never substitute ordinary CLI login, credential copying, sudo or manual
  protocol messages for product first-login acceptance.

Provider browser progress belongs to the initiating helper's private channel,
not a public COM broadcast. Validate browser destinations and attempt ownership;
discard stale/source-mismatched results and redact authorization URLs/codes from
all diagnostic phases. Cancelling the client wait does not log out the provider
or revoke an authorization that already completed.
Retain the validated current-attempt link in the waiting UI with explicit
open/copy actions. A successful OS launch does not prove that the user saw a
browser, and launch failure must not cancel otherwise valid authorization.
Clear the link when the attempt ends. Exercise extension notifications through
actual SDK wire dispatch, including its required extension method naming, rather
than only calling the parser on a locally constructed notification.
Custom ACP commands that use the same advertised Google authentication flow must
receive the same private progress and fallback; a different canonical ID must not
make shared in-protocol onboarding silently unusable. The same destination and
ownership validation remains mandatory.

External login adapters must construct native argument vectors for the selected
source. A WSL provider must sign in inside its distro/default-user environment,
not via a host executable found on Windows PATH. Preserve the existing host
device-login behavior and enterprise-host normalization.

WSL discovery uses the selected user's login shell. A failed shell/profile probe
is not proof that the executable was deleted. Surface that environment and
actionable PATH/profile guidance without inspecting another user's home or
silently rewriting shell configuration.

### Session hooks and history

Implement hooks only when the CLI exposes a documented hook or plugin API that
can observe normal interactive sessions. Inventory the complete lifecycle:

- bundle files under `tools/wta/wt-agent-hooks/<agent>`;
- canonical CLI filtering for `wta hooks install/status/uninstall`;
- startup auto-upgrade and its per-bundle version cache;
- ownership markers, partial-install recovery, and user-file protection;
- session, prompt, tool, notification, error, idle, and end event mappings;
- child/subagent filtering when internal sessions should not become rows;
- an ACP-mode guard so the shared agent-pane process does not emit duplicate
  hook-backed sessions;
- UTF-8 payload handling through every process boundary.

Native hooks must use the existing-only COM connection and never activate a
stopped Terminal. Preserve this behavior when enriching provider payloads.

Normalize a supported CLI identity before provider-specific handling, and make
later source enrichment consume the same canonical identity rather than the raw
command-line spelling.

Treat provider session identifiers as untrusted. Any identifier that reaches a
shell-based CLI resume command must satisfy the same bounded safe-token contract
at publication and at the unquoted execution boundary; ACP-only IDs remain opaque.

Mounted workspace roots are not guaranteed to contain the CLI launch directory.
Hooks can execute in a plugin directory, so their process cwd is not necessarily
the CLI workspace. When provider metadata is absent, use source-compatible cwd
from the owning pane, including known WSL launch metadata before shell reporting;
leave ambiguous directories unknown rather than inventing a home directory.
Do not infer WSL execution from a distro environment variable alone; require the
source-specific forwarded context or the owning pane's reported shell.
Validate distro grammar before any shell-based resume and verify registration
before publishing forwarded distro metadata; reject a known pane/source mismatch.
Master must also validate raw COM hook source metadata before reducing session
state. Corroborate known source/pane ownership without conflating equal session
IDs from different providers; missing hook context is not a new authentication gate.
When a reducer still addresses raw IDs, reject a hook whose ID also belongs to a
different provider rather than modifying an arbitrarily selected qualified row.

Shared provider configuration belongs to the provider. Prefer its native mutation
API; a WTA-only mutex or read-then-rename check does not serialize another client's
writes. If safe native cleanup is unavailable, fail explicitly and preserve state.
Check every existing ownership document for conflicts before invoking a native
installer; a surviving managed marker does not authorize replacing a conflicting
descriptor. Missing managed files may still be repaired.

Follow the current implementations in `agent_hooks_installer.rs`,
`wt-agent-hooks`, and the session registry rather than assuming every CLI has a
marketplace. Some CLIs require a command-driven plugin install, while others
require a managed copy into a global plugin directory. Install ownership
metadata last so it proves a complete install, and remove it last so failed
cleanup remains retryable.

## Terminal (C++/XAML)

### `src/cascadia/inc/AgentRegistry.h`

Add the agent to the ACP built-in list. Add it to the delegate list only when
interactive delegation is supported. Update fixed array sizes and preserve GPO
filtering through `FilteredAcpAgents()` and `FilteredDelegateAgents()`.

Treat delegate and hook support as separate capabilities. First-run setup must
not assign an ACP-only provider as the default delegate or attempt a hook
installation the provider does not support.

If canonical ID, ACP executable and interactive CLI differ, use role-specific
discovery in Settings and FRE. Finding only the ACP server must not select an
uninstalled delegate CLI, and CLI hook reconciliation must resolve the actual CLI.

### ACP command resolution

Search `src/cascadia/TerminalApp/TerminalPage.cpp` and settings code for the
existing built-in ACP command mappings. Ensure the agent pane and model probe
resolve to the same exact ACP command:

- `TerminalPage.cpp` for the runtime agent launch;
- `TerminalSettingsEditor/AIAgentsViewModel.cpp` for model probing and setup
  state.

An ACP server may accept model changes through protocol even when its
interactive CLI accepts a `--model` flag. Do not append unsupported flags to
the server command.

Also follow profile binding, per-tab switching, settings reconciliation, and
Helper reconnect paths. C++ command resolution and master-derived commands must
both select the native executable for the requested source. Keep host catalogs
separate from the same provider's WSL catalogs.

### Settings, telemetry, and discoverability

Search these areas for explicit current-agent lists:

- `TerminalApp/AgentSessionTelemetry.h` and `tools/wta/src/telemetry.rs` for
  sanitized session/provider IDs;
- `TerminalSettingsModel/SettingsTelemetry.h` for provider-change/startup buckets
  and the generic AI-setting suppression boundary; do not restore retired
  per-setting telemetry;
- Settings Editor and TerminalApp resources for localized/fallback names;
- first-run experience and quick selector consumers of `AgentRegistry.h`;
- CLI help text and settings schema/default descriptions.

`TerminalApp/AgentIconResources.xaml` supplies shared foreground-bound vector
templates for both agent-pane chrome and sidebar history. Add the canonical
provider template there and reference it from the pane rather than duplicating
the artwork.

Keep custom commands classified as `custom`; never emit a path or arbitrary
command as a telemetry provider ID.

When hooks are supported, also update the first-run scoped hook install and the
Settings hook status/remove surface. Keep the WTA JSON status schema and the C++
parser synchronized. A detected CLI with no hooks should have an intentional
UI state, and an install left on disk after the CLI is removed must remain
removable.

### Permission modes and usage

Register each family with `protocol/acp/native_yolo/providers` and
`usage/providers`. Native automatic approval uses a reviewed advertised mode or
config option through the shared state machine; preserve the prior mode and
require acknowledgement. Never replace user permission responses with automatic
approval. A provider without a reviewed capability must explicitly remain unsupported.
Use standard ACP usage by default; do not infer private quota/cost APIs.

Inspect Session MCP tool-name qualification in `agent_tools/session_mcp.rs` and
the ACP client's permission/update correlation. Providers can represent the same
scoped tool as `server/tool`, `server-tool`, `server_tool`, or
`mcp__server__tool`. Match the exact current server identity stamped by master;
never recognize a tool by a bare name or suffix alone. The existing invocation-only
permission handling must preserve the helper's final action or question UI.

### Branding

Search `TerminalApp/AgentPaneContent.cpp` and `.xaml` for logo selection and
visibility. Add an official, license-compatible vector asset under the
packaging asset area when appropriate. Ensure:

- deterministic mapping from canonical/display name to the new logo;
- an intentional unknown-agent fallback;
- light and dark theme contrast;
- high-contrast support through theme resources rather than a fixed fill;
- only the selected logo is visible.

## Policy and Documentation

`policies/IntelligentTerminal.admx` defines the generic `AllowedAgents`
`REG_MULTI_SZ`. Runtime filtering normally needs no per-agent schema change,
but update `policies/en-US/IntelligentTerminal.adml`:

- valid identifier list;
- displayed built-in count;
- textbox hint.

Update `README.md` and `doc/faq.md` for support, installation/auth, and honest
limitations. Search for every old built-in count or exhaustive agent list.
Do not include the agent in hooks/history documentation unless those separate
features are implemented.
