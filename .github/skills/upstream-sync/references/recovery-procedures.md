# Recovery procedures (rarely needed)

Three off-the-happy-path procedures that the agent does **not** drive
itself — they require explicit operator decisions. Linked from
[`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) so the main runbook stays focused on the
common case.

## Direct-to-main (admin-only escape hatch)

If the operator explicitly says "skip the PR, push straight to main":
after step 7 succeeds, skip step 8 and instead:

```pwsh
git switch main
git merge --ff-only $branch
git push origin main
git branch -D $branch
```

Requires bypass-branch-protection rights. No PR, no review checkpoint —
use only for explicit admin runs.

## First-time sync (seeding the watermark)

If the fork has no `(cherry picked from commit <sha>)` trailer on
`origin/main` yet, `02-compute-pending.ps1` will throw. To seed,
commit an **empty seed commit** carrying the trailer in its message —
the same format `cherry-pick -x` would emit, written by hand exactly
once:

```pwsh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoft/terminal.git
git fetch upstream main --no-tags
git switch main
# Pick an upstream SHA you consider "already in this fork" (typically
# the commit the fork was originally branched from). Write the trailer
# EXACTLY as cherry-pick -x would so the next sync picks it up.
$seedSha = '<40-char-upstream-sha-already-in-fork>'
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(upstream): seed upstream-sync watermark" -m "(cherry picked from commit $seedSha)"
git push origin main
```

That one merged trailer becomes the watermark. From then on, every
run extends it. No script needed — the bootstrap is one
`commit --allow-empty` ever.

## Squash-merge recovery (don't do this, but if you did)

The PR banner shouts "do not squash" and step 8 arms
`gh pr merge --rebase --auto` (the merge strategy is ultimately a
GitHub UI choice — there is no `-AutoMergeStrategy` flag). If a
reviewer squash-merges anyway, the outcome depends on what GitHub
preserved in the squash commit's body:

- **Trailers preserved (common case).** The squash body concatenates
  every cherry-picked message, so it contains MANY
  `(cherry picked from commit <sha>)` trailers.
  [`02-compute-pending.ps1`](../scripts/02-compute-pending.ps1) walks
  these bottom-up (newest-first) so it picks the **last** trailer —
  which corresponds to the newest upstream commit in the batch. The
  watermark does NOT move backward, and **no recovery is needed**.
  Per-commit attribution on `main` is gone (that's the squash cost),
  but the next sync resumes correctly.
- **Trailers stripped or newest trailer removed.** If the reviewer
  hand-edited the squash body and dropped the newest trailer (or all
  of them), the watermark will resolve to an older SHA and the next
  sync re-picks the gap. To prevent that, do a one-time
  `commit --allow-empty` on `main` carrying the trailer for the
  upstream HEAD that was actually merged — same shape as the first-time
  seed above.
