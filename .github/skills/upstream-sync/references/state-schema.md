## Field rules

- **`last_synced_upstream_sha`** advances **only** when a sync PR is merged.
  The orchestrator updates this in the PR commit itself, so it lands
  atomically with the picks. Never edit by hand except via
  `clear-stuck.ps1`.
- **`stuck_on_sha`** is the Tier-3 gate. When set, `04-run-batch.ps1` exits 0
  without doing anything. This is intentional — the scheduler will keep
  ticking but will not clobber the stuck branch.
- **`stuck_validation`** is the Tier-4 gate, independent of `stuck_on_sha`.
  Either one being non-null causes the scheduler to skip. Cleared by
  `clear-stuck.ps1` — `-ResolvedThroughSha` is optional for Tier-4 (omit
  to keep the watermark and have the next run re-attempt the same range
  after the human fixed whatever validation caught).
- **`findings_hash`** in `stuck_validation` is a stable 16-hex prefix of
  the SHA-256 of the normalized findings list. If a re-run produces the
  same hash, the human knows the underlying fault is unchanged; if it
  changes, validation has moved to a new failure mode.
- **`stuck_branch`** must still exist on `origin` until the human merges
  it; `clear-stuck.ps1` does not delete it (the PR merge does).
- **`history`** is for the human reading state.json directly. The reports
  in `reports/` are the source of truth.

## Concurrency

The scheduler should run on a single host. If multiple hosts run
concurrently, the second one's `git push -u origin upstream-sync/<date>`
will collide on the same-day branch name — `git push` will reject with
non-fast-forward and `04-run-batch.ps1` will exit 20 (hard failure).
This is acceptable: the loser's report is still written locally for
inspection, and no state on `main` has been updated.

If you genuinely need multi-host scheduling, add a per-host suffix to
the branch name and a state-file mutex via `gh api repos/.../contents/...`
GraphQL check-and-set — out of scope for v1.
