# Conflict Triage — Resolution Tiers

When a cherry-pick conflicts, apply tiers **in order**. Stop at the first
tier that fully resolves the conflict.

## Tier 0 — Known take-{upstream,ours} files

Some files have a fixed correct resolution that never changes. Examples:

- `.github/workflows/spelling2.yml` — always take upstream (verified on sister repo `agentic-terminal`).

The list of these paths lives in [`known-conflicts.md`](./known-conflicts.md).

**Algorithm:**

```pwsh
$conflictingPaths = git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
$tier0List = Get-KnownConflicts   # parses known-conflicts.md
foreach ($p in $conflictingPaths) {
    $entry = $tier0List | Where-Object { $_.Path -eq $p }
    if (-not $entry) { return $false }  # Tier 0 doesn't cover this commit
    switch ($entry.Strategy) {
        'take-upstream' { git checkout --theirs -- $p; git add -- $p }
        'take-ours'     { git checkout --ours    -- $p; git add -- $p }
        'union'         { git merge-file --union  ... }
    }
}
git cherry-pick --continue --no-edit
```

If `git status` is now clean and the cherry-pick continued, **Tier 0 fully resolved** — record the file(s) auto-resolved and move on.

## Tier 1 — Empty after staging

After Tier 0 (or with no conflicts to begin with), if the staged diff is
empty, the commit has already been applied to the fork in some prior
form. Skip it without recording a commit:

```pwsh
if ((git diff --cached --quiet; $LASTEXITCODE) -eq 0) {
    git cherry-pick --skip   # equivalent to reset + advance
    return @{ status = 'skipped-empty' }
}
```

## Tier 2 — LLM-assisted trivial textual (opt-in)

Disabled by default; enable with `04-run-batch.ps1 -TryTier2`. Even when
enabled, this tier only fires when **all** of the following hold:

- No more than 3 conflicting files.
- Each file has fewer than 5 conflict hunks.
- Each hunk has fewer than 30 lines on either side.
- No conflicting file is in `src/cascadia/TerminalProtocol/`,
  `src/cascadia/WindowsTerminal/TerminalProtocolComServer.cpp`, or
  `tools/wta/**` (these are fork-only and shouldn't conflict; if they
  somehow do, that's a Tier-3 signal).

**Delegation:**

Spawn a fresh sub-agent (Memory Assistant rules require fresh — never
self-review). Prompt template:

> You are resolving a git cherry-pick conflict mechanically. Below are
> the conflict markers in `<path>`. The fork ("ours") adds AI-agent
> integration; upstream ("theirs") is microsoft/terminal. Produce ONLY
> the resolved file content — no commentary, no markers. If you cannot
> resolve with high confidence (≥0.9), respond with the single token
> `LOW_CONFIDENCE` and nothing else.
>
> Confidence rubric:
> - **High**: changes are non-overlapping in intent (e.g., upstream
>   added a new function near our edit; merge order is obvious).
> - **Low**: both sides modified the same logic / same lines / same
>   public API — semantic decision needed.

**Acceptance:** If the agent returns `LOW_CONFIDENCE`, escalate to
Tier 3. If it returns content, **verify with a second fresh agent**:

> Compare the resolved file against the "ours" version and the "theirs"
> version. Does the resolution preserve all behavioral intent from both
> sides? Respond `OK` or `NOT_OK: <reason>`.

Stage only if both agents agree `high`/`OK`. Otherwise, route to Tier 3.

## Tier 3 — Stop and escalate (cherry-pick conflict)

Anything not resolved by Tier 0–2:

```pwsh
git cherry-pick --abort
# Set state.stuck_on_sha = <sha>, state.stuck_branch = <branch>
# Write the report with the conflict diagnostics
# Open the GitHub issue (07-open-stuck-issue.ps1)
# Exit with code 10
```

The report **must** include:

- The conflicting commit SHA, subject, author, and upstream URL.
- The list of conflicting paths with a one-line classification each
  (`semantic-overlap`, `deleted-by-us`, `binary-merge`, etc.).
- The exact local branch name where the human picks up.
- The exact resume command the human runs after they merge their fix:
  ```
  pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/clear-stuck.ps1 -ResolvedThroughSha <sha>
  ```

## Tier 4 — Post-pick validation failed

The cherry-picks all applied cleanly, but a hard gate after the loop
said NO before any push or PR. This catches the class of bug missed by
git-level conflict detection: clean-merge-but-broken-content (PR #220
audit found duplicate `.resw` keys + a dropped fork-specific `C4459`
suppression — both committed without git ever printing a conflict).

The orchestrator runs three gates after the cherry-pick loop, in order:

| Sub-tier | Gate | Symptom | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4a** | Static breakage scan ([`scripts/08-static-scan.ps1`](../scripts/08-static-scan.ps1)) | New duplicate `.resw` keys vs base, or a missing fork invariant from [`fork-invariants.json`](./fork-invariants.json) | Lock + issue + exit 10 |
| **4b** | Try-build ([`scripts/10-try-build.ps1`](../scripts/10-try-build.ps1)) | Build exited non-zero within timeout | Lock + issue + exit 10 |
| **4c** | Try-build timeout | Wall-clock cap (default 45m) hit | Lock + issue + exit 10 — unless `-AllowInconclusiveBuild` (dev opt-in) |
| **4d** | Toolchain preflight ([`scripts/09-toolchain-preflight.ps1`](../scripts/09-toolchain-preflight.ps1)) | Required `PlatformToolset` (e.g. v143) not present on host | Lock + **NO issue** — provisioning problem, not code |

**Why these three gates and not more.** They were sized to catch the
historical real-world failures with zero false positives:
- 4a covers content-level pattern breakage where git is happy but the
  resulting file violates a fork-specific invariant.
- 4b is the broadest possible "did this even compile" check.
- 4c distinguishes "build hung — needs investigation" from "build
  failed for a discoverable reason".
- 4d distinguishes "this code is broken" from "this host can't even
  try to build it" — the latter must never open a GitHub issue.

Tier-4 state lives in `state.stuck_validation` (separate from
Tier-3's `state.stuck_on_sha`); either being set causes the
scheduler to skip. Clear with [`clear-stuck.ps1`](../scripts/clear-stuck.ps1)
(omit `-ResolvedThroughSha` to keep the watermark and re-attempt the
same range; pass it to advance past the broken upstream batch).

The Tier-4 report includes a `findings_hash` (16-hex prefix). Re-runs
that produce the same hash mean the underlying defect is unchanged;
a changed hash means validation has moved to a new failure mode.

## Line endings

If any Tier-2 resolution touches a file with CRLF line endings (most
`.csproj`, `.xml`, winget manifests, and many `.yml` files on this repo),
re-normalize before staging:

```pwsh
# Inside Tier-2, after writing the resolved content:
$bytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($p)
# Preserve the file's original BOM presence — UTF-8-with-BOM is right
# for .resw / .csproj on this repo, but UTF-8-without-BOM is right for
# many .yml / .md files. Adding a BOM where one wasn't there before
# introduces unrelated encoding diffs and can break tooling.
$hasBom = $bytes.Length -ge 3 -and $bytes[0] -eq 0xEF -and $bytes[1] -eq 0xBB -and $bytes[2] -eq 0xBF
$text   = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($bytes) -replace "`r?`n", "`r`n"
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($p, $text, (New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding($hasBom)))
```

(Skipping this is how the winget-pkgs submission broke last time —
LF mid-file fails CI even though the rest of the file is CRLF.)

## What is NOT a conflict for our purposes

- **Upstream renamed a file we never touched** — git follows the rename
  automatically. No conflict.
- **Upstream deleted a file we never touched** — git removes it. No conflict.
- **Upstream modified a file in a fork-only directory** (e.g., upstream
  somehow touched `tools/wta/`) — impossible by construction since
  upstream doesn't know those files exist. If it ever happens, it's a
  Tier-3 signal that the fork-only directory is misnamed.
