description: 'Periodically sync new commits from microsoft/terminal into this manually-forked intelligent-terminal repo by cherry-picking commit-by-commit onto a dated sync branch, auto-skipping revert pairs and empty commits, auto-resolving known take-upstream files, and stopping cleanly on genuine conflicts with a written report and a GitHub issue. Use when the user asks to "sync upstream", "pull from microsoft/terminal", "run upstream sync", "catch up to upstream", or wires this into a scheduler (weekly/daily).

# Upstream Sync (microsoft/terminal → intelligent-terminal)

Cherry-pick commit-by-commit from `https://github.com/microsoft/terminal`
into this fork, preserving per-commit attribution, skipping commits that
cancel each other out, and stopping cleanly the moment a human-judgment
conflict appears.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "sync upstream", "pull from microsoft/terminal", "catch up to upstream", or "run upstream sync".
- A scheduler (Task Scheduler, cron, GitHub Actions) invokes
  [`scripts/04-run-batch.ps1`](./scripts/04-run-batch.ps1) on a weekly/daily cadence.
- The previous run left a stuck-lock and the human has finished resolving
  the conflict — use [`scripts/clear-stuck.ps1`](./scripts/clear-stuck.ps1) and re-run.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- The user wants a **one-shot rebase** of a single feature branch onto upstream — that's a normal `git rebase`, not this skill.
- The fork has never been initialized (`state.json` missing) — first do the one-time bootstrap from [references/bootstrap.md](./references/bootstrap.md).
- A stuck-lock is set — do not re-run; resolve the conflict on the stuck branch first.

## Prerequisites

- `git` 2.38+ (needed for `git cherry-pick --keep-redundant-commits`, used by `scripts/03-cherry-pick-one.ps1`) and `gh` CLI authenticated against `microsoft/intelligent-terminal`.
- PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`) on PATH.
- Windows build host with Visual Studio 2022, Windows SDK, `vswhere`, and the repo's `tools\razzle.cmd`/`bz` build environment for the default validation gates (or use `-SkipBuild` only for explicit dev/debug runs).
- Remote named `upstream` pointing at `https://github.com/microsoft/terminal.git`
  (the scripts create it if missing).
- `state.json` initialized once (see [references/bootstrap.md](./references/bootstrap.md)).

## Why Cherry-Pick (Not Rebase, Not Merge)

| Approach | Why rejected / chosen |
|---|---|
| **Rebase** `upstream/main` | ❌ Fork history contains old "Merge upstream" commits; rebase replays them and explodes conflicts. Verified failure on sister repo `agentic-terminal`. |
| **Merge** `upstream/main` | ⚠️ Works, but collapses the whole sync into one blob commit — kills per-commit review, kills `git bisect`. |
| **Cherry-pick commit-by-commit** | ✅ Preserves authorship + per-commit content, allows mechanical revert-pair skipping, produces a reviewable PR with N small commits. |

## Step-by-Step Workflow

The scheduler entrypoint is a single PowerShell script. Full procedure
with commands, exit codes, and the per-step delegation map lives in
[references/workflow.md](./references/workflow.md).

```
fetch upstream → compute pending → drop revert pairs → drop empties
  → create sync branch → cherry-pick loop (auto-resolve T0/T1, abort on T3)
  → toolchain preflight → static breakage scan → try-build (Tier-4 gates)
  → write report (always) → push + open PR  OR  open stuck issue + lock
```

**Safety guarantees (post-pick validation pipeline).** Even when every
cherry-pick applies cleanly, content-level breakage can slip in (duplicate
`.resw` keys from a fork-local commit + an upstream rename touching the
same names; a take-upstream resolution silently dropping a fork-specific
warning suppression; etc. — see PR #220 audit). Before any push or PR,
the orchestrator now runs three hard gates:

1. **Toolchain preflight** ([`scripts/09-toolchain-preflight.ps1`](./scripts/09-toolchain-preflight.ps1)) — verifies the host has the `PlatformToolset` versions the repo requires. Missing → **Tier-4d infra-stuck** (lock set, NO GitHub issue — PR review can't fix host provisioning).
2. **Static breakage scan** ([`scripts/08-static-scan.ps1`](./scripts/08-static-scan.ps1)) — baseline-diffs `.resw` files for newly-duplicated `<data name>` keys, and regex-checks fork invariants from [`references/fork-invariants.json`](./references/fork-invariants.json). Blocking → **Tier-4a stuck**.
3. **Try-build** ([`scripts/10-try-build.ps1`](./scripts/10-try-build.ps1)) — runs `tools\razzle.cmd && bz no_clean` with a 45-minute wall-clock cap. Build failed → **Tier-4b stuck**; timeout → **Tier-4c stuck** (unless `-AllowInconclusiveBuild`).

See [references/static-scan.md](./references/static-scan.md), [references/build-verification.md](./references/build-verification.md), and [references/conflict-triage.md](./references/conflict-triage.md) Tier-4 for details.

**Run it:**

```pwsh
# Default: open a PR, let a human pick the merge strategy (must be rebase or merge — NOT squash)
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1

# Open a PR AND arm GitHub auto-merge with rebase strategy (hands-off once CI/approvals pass)
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1 -AutoMergeStrategy rebase

# Skip the PR entirely — fast-forward main to the sync tip. Requires admin/bypass on main.
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1 -PushDirectToMain

# Compute & report without picking
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1 -DryRun

# Skip the static scan (debugging only — schedulers must run it)
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1 -SkipStaticScan

# Skip the try-build (debugging only — schedulers must run it).
# Also skips toolchain preflight since they share the same infra prerequisite.
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1 -SkipBuild

# Don't treat a build timeout as Tier-4 stuck (dev opt-in; never in a scheduler)
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1 -AllowInconclusiveBuild

# Override build timeout (default 45 minutes)
pwsh .github/skills/upstream-sync/scripts/04-run-batch.ps1 -BuildTimeoutMinutes 60
```

### Finalize modes — what each preserves

| Mode | Per-commit content | Order on main | Original author + committer dates | Reviewer checkpoint | Requires admin? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PR + **rebase-merge** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | No |
| PR + **merge commit** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | No |
| PR + **squash** | ❌ collapsed | ❌ | ⚠️ folded | ✅ | No |
| **`-PushDirectToMain`** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Yes (push to main) |

The cherry-pick loop pins both author and committer identity/dates to the
upstream commit so audit timestamps match the original commit-by-commit history.

Resumability is built into the state file — re-running after a successful
run is a fast no-op (nothing pending), and re-running while the stuck-lock
is set exits early without touching the branch.

### After-PR review handling — fix-in-PR vs. follow-up PR

Once the sync PR is open, Copilot and human reviewers will leave
comments. The cherry-pick PR's commits must stay reviewable as
"per-commit, faithful to upstream + minimal must-merge delta" so the
reviewer can spot-check each upstream commit was applied correctly.
That constraint shapes the response policy:

| Comment type | Where to fix |
|---|---|
| **Build-blocking** (compile error, dedup of resw/manifest collisions exposed only at build time, CI gate failure on the sync PR itself) | **One** focused extra commit on the sync branch. The cherry-pick PR is what's broken; the cherry-pick PR is what gets the fix. |
| **Everything else** — code-quality findings, logic-bug suggestions, translation corrections, spelling-allowlist migrations, typo fixes, doc nits, design feedback | **Follow-up PR** on top of the cherry-pick PR (see [references/follow-up-pr.md](./references/follow-up-pr.md)) |

**Why split.** A reviewer scanning the cherry-pick PR is auditing
"did the sync engine faithfully apply the upstream batch?" Mixing
substantive review feedback into the same PR forces them to mentally
subtract those commits from every upstream-comparison check. Worse,
amending or squashing in review fixes destroys the per-commit
attribution the cherry-pick approach was chosen to preserve.

**Follow-up PR shape** (template in
[references/follow-up-pr.md](./references/follow-up-pr.md)):

- New worktree + branch `dev/<alias>/sync-<sync-pr-number>-review-fixes`
  off the sync PR's HEAD (see
  [branch-worktree-workflow](./references/follow-up-pr.md#worktree-setup)).
- Base = the sync branch (e.g. `upstream-sync/2026-06-04`), **not**
  `main`. The follow-up rides along with the sync PR.
- One focused commit per concern (code-bugs / translations /
  spelling-cleanup / etc.) — same "audit trail per finding" rule as the
  Copilot PR review loop skill.
- Reply + resolve every original thread on the sync PR pointing to the
  follow-up PR number.
- If the sync PR merges first, rebase the follow-up onto `main` before
  it merges.

The orchestrator's PR banner ([scripts/06-finalize-pr.ps1](./scripts/06-finalize-pr.ps1))
spells this policy out to the first reviewer so they don't push back on
deferred fixes.

## Gotchas

- **Never squash-merge the sync PR.** Squash collapses every cherry-picked
  upstream commit into one, destroying per-commit attribution, original
  author dates, and `git bisect` resolution. Use **"Rebase and merge"**
  (preferred) or **"Create a merge commit"**. The PR body opens with a
  banner reminding the reviewer; `-AutoMergeStrategy rebase` arms GitHub
  auto-merge with the right strategy so a tired reviewer can't get it
  wrong.
- **Don't amend review fixes into the sync PR.** Only build-blocking
  fixes (compile errors, dedup of conflicts that surface at build time,
  CI gate failures on the sync PR itself) get **one** extra commit on
  the sync branch. Substantive Copilot/human review feedback —
  code-quality, logic, translations, spelling-list migrations, doc nits
  — goes into a separate follow-up PR off the sync branch's HEAD. See
  [references/follow-up-pr.md](./references/follow-up-pr.md). Mixing
  them poisons the "faithful to upstream" audit of the cherry-pick PR.
- **Never rebase `upstream/main` onto this fork.** Old "Merge upstream"
  commits in the fork history replay and cascade conflicts. Use cherry-pick.
  Verified failure mode on the sister repo `agentic-terminal`.
- **`.github/workflows/spelling2.yml` always conflicts** and the correct
  resolution is always "take upstream wholesale". The Tier-0 list in
  [references/known-conflicts.md](./references/known-conflicts.md) handles
  this automatically — extend the list when you discover the next file
  with the same pattern.
- **`gh pr create` on Windows can fail with "Head sha can't be blank"** if the
  branch is freshly pushed and not yet visible. The same-repo finalize script
  intentionally uses `--head <branch>` plus a 5s retry — do not "fix" it to
  `--head <owner>:<branch>`, which would point `gh` at a fork.
- **Do not run the scheduler twice while stuck.** The lock in
  `state.json` makes the second run a no-op, but a human running the
  script manually with `-Force` will overwrite the stuck branch and lose
  their in-progress resolution. The `-Force` flag is documented but
  intentionally not the default.
- **Cherry-pick over `git revert` style commits is intentional, not skipped.**
  We only skip revert-pairs where **both** sides are inside the pending
  range. A revert of a commit we already merged last week must land as a
  normal pick — otherwise the fork diverges silently.
- **Always commit `state.json` and `reports/`** so the next scheduler
  invocation (possibly on a different machine) starts from the right
  checkpoint. The finalize PR includes the state update.
- **Prefer the PR path.** The default workflow always opens a PR so CI and
  human review checkpoint the upstream batch. Use `-PushDirectToMain` only
  for an explicit admin/bypass run where skipping PR latency is intentional.
- **CRLF/LF on manifest files.** Cherry-picks normally preserve upstream
  line endings, but any in-flight resolution touched by an LLM may downgrade
  to LF. If a Tier-2 resolution touches a `.yml`/`.xml`/`.csproj`/winget
  manifest, re-normalize before staging — see
  [references/conflict-triage.md](./references/conflict-triage.md#line-endings).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| `state.json` is missing | Run the one-time bootstrap — see [references/bootstrap.md](./references/bootstrap.md). Do not guess the baseline SHA. |
| Stuck-lock prevents new run | Resolve the conflict on the stuck branch, open a PR, merge, then run [`scripts/clear-stuck.ps1`](./scripts/clear-stuck.ps1) and re-run the batch. |
| Cherry-pick reports "empty commit" | Expected for upstream no-op commits and for fork-already-applied patches; the loop auto-resets and marks them skipped. No action needed. |
| Same file conflicts every run | Add it to the Tier-0 list in [references/known-conflicts.md](./references/known-conflicts.md) with the correct resolution strategy (`take-upstream`, `take-ours`, or `union`). |
| `gh pr create` returns "Head sha can't be blank" | Retry — the finalize script already does, but on slow networks may need a manual second run. |
| Report says "no-op" but I expected commits | Run `git fetch upstream main` manually and recompute — the scheduler may have run between upstream pushes. |
