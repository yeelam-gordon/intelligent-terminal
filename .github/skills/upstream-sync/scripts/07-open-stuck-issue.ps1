.SYNOPSIS
  Set the stuck-lock and open a GitHub issue. Pushes the stuck branch
  to origin so the human can pick it up.

.PARAMETER Ctx
  Run context (must have StuckSha, StuckPaths, Branch set).

.PARAMETER ReportPath
  Absolute path to the stuck report markdown.

.OUTPUTS
  Issue URL on stdout (and writes Ctx.IssueUrl).

🛑 **Upstream sync stopped at a conflict that needs human judgment.**

The scheduler will keep skipping its runs until this issue is resolved
and the stuck-lock is cleared. No alarm — the lock is intentional.

To unblock, follow "How to resume" in the report below, then close this
issue after ``clear-stuck.ps1`` runs cleanly.
