<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Push the sync branch and open a PR. Commits state.json + report onto
  the branch first so the merge atomically advances last_synced.

.PARAMETER Ctx
  Run context from 04-run-batch.ps1.

.PARAMETER To
  Upstream HEAD SHA at fetch time (becomes new last_synced_upstream_sha).

.PARAMETER ReportPath
  Absolute path to the report markdown to use as the PR body.

.OUTPUTS
  PR URL on stdout (and writes Ctx.PrUrl).

> ⚠️ **DO NOT squash-merge this PR.** Squashing collapses every cherry-picked

> merge"** (preferred — flat history, all $($Ctx.Picked.Count) commits land
> individually) or **"Create a merge commit"** (also preserves per-commit
> content).
>
> 📝 **Review-fix policy.** Only build-blocking fixes (compile errors, dedup
> of conflicts surfaced at build time, CI gate failures on this PR itself)
> belong here — as **one** focused extra commit on this branch. All other
> Copilot / human review feedback (code-quality, logic, translation,
> spelling-list migrations, doc nits) goes into a **follow-up PR** based on
> this PR's head, not amended into the cherry-pick commits. Rationale and
> mechanics: [``.github/skills/upstream-sync/references/follow-up-pr.md``](https://github.com/microsoft/intelligent-terminal/blob/main/.github/skills/upstream-sync/references/follow-up-pr.md).
