.SYNOPSIS
  Clear the stuck-lock (Tier-3 or Tier-4) after a human has resolved
  the underlying issue.

.DESCRIPTION
  Detects which kind of stuck is currently set in state.json and clears it:

  - Tier-3 (stuck_on_sha set): the scheduler stopped mid-cherry-pick on
    a real merge conflict. -ResolvedThroughSha is REQUIRED and is
    validated to be on upstream/main and >= stuck_on_sha; it becomes
    the new last_synced_upstream_sha.

  - Tier-4 (stuck_validation set): the picks were clean but post-pick
    validation failed (static scan / build / toolchain). The human
    fixed it (e.g. resw dedup, restored fork invariant, fixed build,
    or provisioned the missing toolset). -ResolvedThroughSha is
    OPTIONAL — if omitted, last_synced_upstream_sha is left as-is so
    the next scheduler run re-attempts the same range; if provided,
    it advances the watermark just like Tier-3.

.PARAMETER ResolvedThroughSha
  See above.

.PARAMETER Reason
  Optional human-readable note recorded in the history entry.
