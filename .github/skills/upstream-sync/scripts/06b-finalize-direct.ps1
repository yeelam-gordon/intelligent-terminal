.SYNOPSIS
  Finalize the sync by fast-forwarding main directly to the sync branch.
  Use when you have admin/bypass perms on main and want zero PR latency.

.DESCRIPTION
  Preserves per-commit content, order, and original author + committer
  dates, because the cherry-pick loop pins both from each upstream commit.

  Assumes the caller is currently on the sync branch with all picks
  applied. Performs:
    1. Add state.json + report, commit on the sync branch.
    2. Switch to main, pull --ff-only.
    3. Fast-forward main to the sync branch tip (refuses if main diverged).
    4. Push main.
    5. Delete the local sync branch (remote was never pushed).

.PARAMETER Ctx
  Run context.

.PARAMETER To
  Upstream HEAD SHA at fetch time (becomes new last_synced_upstream_sha).

.PARAMETER ReportPath
  Path to the markdown report (will be committed onto the sync branch).

.OUTPUTS
  Writes the new main HEAD SHA to stdout and to Ctx.MainHeadSha.
