# Ensure Localization

Use this shared procedure for customer-facing localization. The caller supplies
the goal, scope, and permitted edits; PR or workflow context is not required.

## Product consistency

Keep terminology consistent within each locale and across RESW and localization
YAML for the same product. Grammar may vary with context, but established product
keywords should not alternate between unrelated translations.

## Caller context

The caller owns repository or PR context, trusted revisions, skip policy,
automation allowlists, and safe-output rules. This skill owns only the reusable
file-based localization procedure.

## Resources

- File checker: [`./scripts/localization_checks.ps1`](./scripts/localization_checks.ps1)

## Supported files

The skill applies to localization resources regardless of their location. The
checker supports `.resw` and flat locale `.yml` files; other YAML structures need
an appropriate parser, not conversion merely to satisfy this checker.

Discover source and target files using the caller's context and existing layout.
In this repository, `en-US` files and direct resource files are common source
authorities; these are conventions, not mandatory checker paths.

Do not edit source-authority files just to make translations pass.

## Source-authoring guidance

- Add translator context when wording is ambiguous or depends on UI usage, such
  as a noun versus a command. Explain the meaning and placeholder roles; avoid
  boilerplate comments for obvious strings.
- Use `{Locked}` when the whole value must remain literal, and
  `{Locked="token"}` for invariant parts such as product names, protocol names,
  commands, or paths. Use locale-scoped locks only when the exception genuinely
  applies to those locales; do not exempt entire pseudo-locales by default.
- Put guidance in the resource's `<comment>` for RESW or its associated YAML
  comment. Preserve annotations in target files where the format requires them.
- When source edits are not permitted, report missing or contradictory source
  guidance instead of silently changing source files or inventing meaning.
  Mechanical checks preserve declared locks; they cannot decide which
  annotations a new string needs.

## Six checks

| Check | Required args | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Test-ResourceSyntax` | `-File` | Parse supported XML or flat locale YAML shape |
| `Test-ResourceEncoding` | `-File` (`-OriginalFile` optional) | Enforce UTF-8 and expected BOM behavior |
| `Test-RequiredKeys` | `-SourceFile -TargetFile` (`-Keys` optional for PowerShell callers; CLI uses `-KeysJson` when scoping) | Missing and stale key parity |
| `Test-PlaceholderParity` | `-SourceFile -TargetFile` (`-Keys` optional for PowerShell callers; CLI uses `-KeysJson` when scoping) | Placeholder identity and count parity |
| `Test-LockedContent` | `-SourceFile -TargetFile` (`-Locale` sometimes required, `-Keys` optional for PowerShell callers; CLI uses `-KeysJson` when scoping) | Preserve locked values and tokens |
| `Test-PseudoLocale` | `-SourceFile -TargetFile -Locale` (`-Keys` optional for PowerShell callers; CLI uses `-KeysJson` when scoping) | Catch English fallback and pseudo-style mistakes |

Example commands:

```powershell
pwsh .github/skills/ensure-localization/scripts/localization_checks.ps1 -Check Test-ResourceSyntax -File <file>
pwsh .github/skills/ensure-localization/scripts/localization_checks.ps1 -Check Test-ResourceEncoding -File <file> [-OriginalFile <original-file>]
pwsh .github/skills/ensure-localization/scripts/localization_checks.ps1 -Check Test-RequiredKeys -SourceFile <source-file> -TargetFile <target-file> [-KeysJson '["key1","key2"]']
pwsh .github/skills/ensure-localization/scripts/localization_checks.ps1 -Check Test-PlaceholderParity -SourceFile <source-file> -TargetFile <target-file> [-KeysJson '["key1","key2"]']
pwsh .github/skills/ensure-localization/scripts/localization_checks.ps1 -Check Test-LockedContent -SourceFile <source-file> -TargetFile <target-file> [-Locale <locale>] [-KeysJson '["key1","key2"]']
pwsh .github/skills/ensure-localization/scripts/localization_checks.ps1 -Check Test-PseudoLocale -SourceFile <source-file> -TargetFile <target-file> -Locale <pseudo-locale> [-KeysJson '["key1","key2"]']
```

The script writes one JSON bundle to stdout and exits with the actual status
mapping:

- `0` → `PASS`
- `20` → `FIXABLE`
- `30` → `BLOCKED`
- `64` → `INVALID_INPUT`

## Native final-report handoff

When a caller specifies a final checker report path, collect bundles from actual
checker execution; never fabricate bundle fields or convert human conclusions
into checker JSON. Keep initial failing attempts out of the final report. The
root agent owns repository discovery, the final rerun, and writing the report.
After repairs and any required independent review, write only the final rerun
bundles using the caller's exact envelope and path. The caller's native
post-step owns structural validation and write gating.

For initial checks and the final rerun, use one `pwsh` process per batch that dot-sources
`localization_checks.ps1` once and calls the public functions directly. Each
completed check returns one bundle object with `check`, `status`, `exitCode`,
`summary`, and `results`. Invalid required arguments can throw; let the batch
fail rather than write a partial report. Collect those actual bundle objects and write the
caller-selected JSON envelope with PowerShell file operations only. Do not
delegate report ownership to a reviewer and do not rely on `rm`, `touch`,
`jq`, or hand-authored bundle JSON.

Example final rerun in one PowerShell process. This example intentionally shows
scoped batch rows only: each row must be a PowerShell hashtable with an explicit non-empty
`RequiredKeys` array and an explicit `ComparableKeys` array, which may be
empty until the key exists on both sides. For whole-file checks outside this
scoped batch pattern, omit `-Keys` when calling the public checker functions as
shown in the API table above. Assume the caller already resolved the report
path, mode, and scoped source/target/locale rows to inspect.
Use scoped `RequiredKeys` only for source-present additions or updates. Handle
source removals and target stale-entry cleanup with the explicit git/file
review from reusable procedure step 1 instead of forcing source-absent names
through scoped `-Keys`. Pass only already-comparable keys to
`Test-PlaceholderParity`, `Test-LockedContent`, and `Test-PseudoLocale`;
those dependent checks intentionally return `BLOCKED` when the scoped key is
missing from either side:

```powershell

$bundles = [System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]::new()

## Reusable procedure

1. Read the exact original localization patch content against the
   caller-supplied immutable endpoints before choosing keys or counterpart
   files. Use:
   `git diff --no-ext-diff --unified=3 <comparison-base> <immutable-head> -- <resource paths>`.
   Supporting summaries such as `git diff --stat`, `--name-only`,
   `--name-status`, `--numstat`, `git status`, or a worktree-only
   `git diff -- <file>` are useful for discovery but are not sufficient to
   derive scoped keys, values, or review coverage. If the diff output is
   truncated, continue fetching the remaining hunks until you have read the
   full patch for every relevant resource file. Derive the precise added or
   updated source keys, values, and surrounding context from that exact patch;
   do not infer scope from file prefixes, neighboring samples, unchanged source
   lines, or PR summaries.
   - Source-authority add or update: expand to every shipped localized
     counterpart that should carry the affected file or keys, even when those
     target files are unchanged in the git diff.
   - Target-only edit: inspect that localized target against its source
     authority.
   - Source key or file removal: inspect obsolete shipped counterparts with
     ordinary git and file review. Handle removal or cleanup explicitly instead
     of claiming `PASS` because no file-pair check ran.
2. Map each localized target to its source-authority file. In this repository,
   `.resw` targets map to `.../Resources/en-US/*.resw` or direct
   `.../Resources/*.resw`, and WTA locale targets map to
   `tools/wta/locales/en-US.yml`.
3. Before translating changed terms, inspect existing translations in the same
   locale across both `.resw` files and `tools/wta/locales/*.yml`. Reuse
   established product terminology when the meaning and UI context match. If no
   repository precedent exists, prefer Microsoft localized terms and flag
   conflicting existing translations instead of inventing synonyms or rewriting
   unrelated strings.
4. Use `-Keys` only for native PowerShell function calls, or `-KeysJson` when
   invoking the checker script from the CLI. Optional key scoping exists to
   avoid fixing unrelated old debt, not to hide source additions that the
   procedure already put in scope. Omit the scope parameter entirely for a
   whole-file check.
5. Run `Test-ResourceSyntax` and `Test-ResourceEncoding` on every file you
   actually inspect.
6. For each localized target, run `Test-RequiredKeys` against the full scoped
   source-present change list, then run `Test-PlaceholderParity`,
   `Test-LockedContent`, and, for pseudo-locales, `Test-PseudoLocale` only for
   keys that are present in both the source-authority file and that target.
   If a scoped key is missing on either side, keep the `Test-RequiredKeys`
   finding and do not force the dependent checks across that absent entry. If
   the source key or file was removed, handle that cleanup with step 1's
   explicit review instead of treating the deleted source name as a scoped
   `-Keys` item. If no comparable keys remain for a scoped target pair, skip
   those dependent checks for that pair.
7. Same-repo repair: run the checks before editing, repair only localized
   targets, preserve the original patch-derived scope through the final rerun,
   recompute each row's `ComparableKeys` from the final on-disk source/target
   files after every edit, include any newly translated source-added keys in
   that rebuilt comparable set, rerun the same relevant checks, then finish
   with one independent read-only review before requesting any branch write.
   Do not swap in a different guessed key set or reuse a stale pre-edit
   comparable subset after a missing key has been added.
8. Read-only review or fork guidance: stay read-only; report only the actual
   `PASS`, `FIXABLE`, `BLOCKED`, or `INVALID_INPUT` outcomes plus concise human
   review.

## Gotchas

- The public checker API is file-only. Do not pass PR numbers, SHAs, repo
  names, comparison-base discovery, or workflow `Mode` values.
- `Test-RequiredKeys` can report missing entries and stale keys for a provided
  source/target file pair, but it does not discover which untouched locale
  files or deleted source-file counterparts must be inspected. The caller or
  agent must do that repository discovery.
- A clean working tree or a bare `git diff -- <file>` can hide the authored
  base-to-head change set you are supposed to review. Always inspect the full
  `<comparison-base> <immutable-head>` patch when deriving scope.
- `Test-SourceUnchanged`, `Gate`, and `Validate` are intentionally gone. Skip
  decisions such as “formatting-only, do not spend AI” belong to the
  caller/workflow.
- `Test-ResourceEncoding` is the only check that reasons about BOM
  preservation. Keep source-preservation and safe-write policy in the caller,
  and supply `-OriginalFile` whenever a comparison snapshot exists.
- When batching in one process, carry forward genuine pre-edit snapshot paths
  for existing files. If a file has no snapshot, omit `OriginalFile` rather
  than pointing it at the rewritten file.
- When the caller scopes keys, do not automatically reuse that same list for
  `Test-PlaceholderParity`, `Test-LockedContent`, or `Test-PseudoLocale`.
  Those APIs deliberately return `BLOCKED` when a scoped key is absent from the
  source or target file. Use the full scoped list for `Test-RequiredKeys`, then
  derive a comparable-only subset for the dependent checks.
- Do not put source-removed names into scoped `-Keys` just to chase stale
  target entries. That is explicit review-and-cleanup work from step 1. A
  source-absent scoped key is a genuine `BLOCKED` input, not a fixable stale
  entry.
- After repairing a previously missing scoped key, recompute that
  comparable-only subset from the final on-disk files before the final rerun.
  A stale pre-edit empty `ComparableKeys` array can incorrectly skip
  placeholder, lock, or pseudo-locale validation for the new translated
  source-added entry.
- If your tool output truncates the original patch, keep reading until every
  localization hunk has been seen. Never guess key scope from file names,
  prefixes, or partial excerpts.
- For in-process batching, use the dot-sourced public functions with a real
  PowerShell key array such as `@('key1', 'key2')`. `-KeysJson` is only for
  `pwsh -File` CLI calls.
- When you invoke `localization_checks.ps1` from `pwsh -File`, use `-KeysJson`
  for scoped keys. `-Keys key1,key2` is ambiguous at the CLI layer and is not
  the supported script interface.
- A source-only, blocked, or excluded-file result is not a successful repair.
  Comment or fail honestly instead of pretending `PASS`.
