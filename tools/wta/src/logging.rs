///     job-close and an unexpected exit to `terminal-agent-pane.log`. This
///     handler fires for the master only on genuine console signals
///     (logoff/shutdown), if delivered at all.
///   * A hard `TerminateProcess` (Task Manager "End task", `taskkill /F`, an
///     OS resource kill, or the Job-Object reap above) delivers no control
///     event and stays untraceable from inside the process.
///   * While the Ratatui TUI holds the console in raw mode, Ctrl+C arrives as
