//! Local command recall for autofix (issue #287).
//!
//! When a command fails with a "not found" error, the autofix agent used to
//! give generic advice without knowing whether the command even exists on the
//! user's machine — so it never suggested the *local* PowerShell scripts and
//! programs on PATH that the user most likely mistyped.
//!
//! This module computes "did you mean" near-matches grounded in the user's
//! real environment. The flow (PowerShell only in v1) is:
//!
//! 1. [`extract_command_token`] pulls the executable name out of the failing
//!    command line (the first line of the captured `[command + output]`
//!    buffer — see `ControlCore::ReadLastPrompt`, which starts at the FTCS
//!    command mark, so there is no prompt prefix to strip).
//! 2. A cheap in-process `which` pre-gate: if the token resolves as a plain
//!    PATH program, the failure was *not* a not-found, so nothing is injected
//!    and no subprocess is spawned (the common case — failed build/test/git).
//! 3. Otherwise, enumerate the shell's real command list once
//!    (`Get-Command …`) and, if the token still doesn't resolve, rank the
//!    list by Damerau-Levenshtein ([`rank_near_matches`]) to surface the
//!    closest existing commands.
//!
//! The gate is locale-independent: it asks the shell "does this command
//! exist", never matches the (localized) error text. The `which` pre-gate
//! skips the enumerate subprocess only for tokens that resolve as plain PATH
//! programs; a failing cmdlet / alias / function token — which `which` can't
//! see — still spawns the enumerate and then bails out via the existence
//! gate. So the subprocess runs for any token that *looks* not-found to PATH,
//! not only a genuine not-found.
//!
//! Profile-defined aliases/functions (issue #286): the enumerate loads the
//! user's interactive profile first, so an alias set only in `$PROFILE` (e.g.
//! `which` → `where.exe`) is enumerated and recognized. Because a profile runs
//! arbitrary user code that can be slow or block, the profile enumerate is
//! bounded by [`PROFILE_ENUMERATE_TIMEOUT`] and falls back to a fast
//! `-NoProfile` enumerate on timeout/failure (see
//! [`enumerate_powershell_commands`]). Still-uncovered: aliases/functions
//! defined *ad hoc* in the running interactive session (never persisted to a
//! profile) — those live only in that session's memory, which a separate
//! subprocess can't observe.
