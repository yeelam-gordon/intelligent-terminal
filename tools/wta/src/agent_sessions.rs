// tools/wta/src/agent_sessions.rs
//
// Runtime registry for tracking live and historical CLI agent sessions.
// Independent from `agent_registry.rs`, which is the static catalog of
// CLI profiles.
//
// Two GUIDs flow through this module — they are DIFFERENT things and must
// not be confused:
//
//   * `pane_session_id` (== $env:WT_SESSION in the agent's pane):
//       The Windows Terminal pane/connection GUID. Set by
//       ConptyConnection.cpp on every spawned shell. Used as the routing
//       key for `wtcli focus-pane -t <guid>` and for filtering "is this
//       event from our own pane?". Plain GUID, no braces.
//
//   * `key` (the AgentKey, derived from the CLI agent's own session id):
//       Claude's UUID under ~/.claude/projects/.../<uuid>.jsonl, Gemini's
//       `sessionId` field, Copilot's session-state folder name. This is
//       what `claude --resume <id>` consumes. Stable across pane
//       lifetimes — a resumed session keeps the same key but gets a
//       brand-new pane_session_id.
//
// `resolve_or_synthesize_key` synthesises a `pane:<guid>` key from
// pane_session_id only when the agent's own session id is unknown
// (e.g. Copilot CLI doesn't fire any hooks). Such a row cannot be
// resumed — it's only valid while the pane is live.
