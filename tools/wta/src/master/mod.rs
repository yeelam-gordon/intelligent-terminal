// tools/wta/src/master/mod.rs
//
// `wta-master` mode — the singleton ACP multiplexer half of the
// helper+master architecture (see doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md).
//
// Responsibilities:
//   1. Spawn the agent CLI subprocess (claude / copilot / gemini)
//      and wrap its stdio in a `ConnectionTo<Agent>` (master is the
//      *client* of the agent CLI — same role that legacy wta plays
//      today). Built via the `conn.rs` shim (`ClientLink` /
//      `spawn_client`) so call sites keep the old `conn.method().await`
//      shape.
//   2. Listen on a named pipe (path supplied by the C++ side via
//      `--master <pipe-name>`). Accept one wta-helper per connect.
//   3. For each helper, run a `ConnectionTo<Client>` in which master
//      plays the *agent* role (via the shim: `AgentLink` /
//      `spawn_agent`). Forward helper requests to the agent CLI; route
//      inbound `session_notification`s from the agent CLI back to the
//      helper that owns the session.
//
// Forwarding paths:
//   * `helper → master → agent CLI`: every helper request runs
//     through `HelperHandler`'s dispatch (inherent fns on the
//     agent-side builder), a thin pass-through to the agent CLI's
//     `ClientLink`.
//   * `agent CLI → master → helper` (notifications): inbound
//     `session_notification`s land in `MasterClient::session_notification`
//     and are fanned out to the owning helper's notification channel
//     via the `session_to_helper` map (populated in `new_session` /
//     `load_session`).
//   * `agent CLI → master → helper` (requests — request_permission,
//     terminal/*, fs/*): same map carries each helper's `AgentLink`.
//     `MasterClient` looks up the helper by `args.session_id` and calls
//     the matching `AgentLink` method, which re-issues each call as an
//     RPC request over the helper's pipe. The helper-side `WtaClient`
//     then runs the same code path it ran pre-helper-split (TUI
//     permission UI, `ShellManager`, etc.).
