// tools/wta/src/master/mod.rs
//
// `wta-master` mode — the singleton ACP multiplexer half of the
// helper+master architecture (see doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md).
//
// Responsibilities:
//   1. Spawn the agent CLI subprocess (claude / copilot / gemini)
//      and wrap its stdio in an `acp::ClientSideConnection` (master
//      is the *client* of the agent CLI — same role that legacy
//      wta plays today).
//   2. Listen on a named pipe (path supplied by the C++ side via
//      `--master <pipe-name>`). Accept one wta-helper per connect.
//   3. For each helper, run an `acp::AgentSideConnection` in which
//      master plays the *agent* role. Forward helper requests to
//      the agent CLI; route inbound `session_notification`s from
//      the agent CLI back to the helper that owns the session.
//
// Forwarding paths:
//   * `helper → master → agent CLI`: every helper request runs
//     through `HelperHandler`'s `acp::Agent` impl, which is just a
//     thin pass-through to the agent CLI's `ClientSideConnection`.
//   * `agent CLI → master → helper` (notifications): inbound
//     `session_notification`s land in `MasterClient::session_notification`
//     and are fanned out to the owning helper's notification channel
//     via the `session_to_helper` map (populated in `new_session` /
//     `load_session`).
//   * `agent CLI → master → helper` (requests — request_permission,
//     terminal/*, fs/*): same map carries an `Arc<AgentSideConnection>`
//     to each helper. `MasterClient` looks up the helper by
//     `args.session_id` and calls the matching `Client`-trait method
//     on that connection (`AgentSideConnection` itself implements
//     `acp::Client` and re-issues each call as an RPC request over the
//     helper's pipe). The helper-side `WtaClient` then runs the same
//     code path it ran pre-helper-split (TUI permission UI,
//     `ShellManager`, etc.).

    //        handler runs. Without master subscribing directly, the F2
    //        row stays stuck at Idle indefinitely.
    //      * Helper crash / kill: any path that prevents the helper
    //        from observing-then-publishing the event.
    //
    //    Copilot / Claude work today because their Stop / SessionEnd
    //    hooks fire fast enough during the CTRL_CLOSE grace window;
    //    Gemini does not. Subscribing here makes the demotion path
