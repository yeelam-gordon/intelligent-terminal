# wt-agent-hooks

Static plugin/extension bundle that forwards CLI agent lifecycle events from
**Claude Code**, **Copilot CLI**, **Codex CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, and **OpenCode**
to Windows Terminal (WTA)
via `wtcli`. This lets the WTA agent pane display real-time tool
use, prompts, and session events from any agent CLI session running in another
pane.

## Layout

This directory is the **single source of truth** for everything WTA installs
into the supported CLIs. Each CLI gets its own self-contained subtree that is
passed verbatim to that CLI's marketplace / extensions command:

```

Every integration dispatches through the native `wtcli agent-hook` command,
invoked directly from `hooks.json` with no script or batch launcher in between.
Claude and Copilot share the same plugin manifest and event schema.

## How install works

The first-run setup installs hooks for the agent selected in FRE. Afterward,
automatic reconciliation runs when session management is enabled at
`wta-master` startup, when the setting changes from off to on, and when the
selected built-in agent changes. Manual repair remains available through
`wta hooks install`. All automatic paths end up in
`agent_hooks_installer::reconcile_agent_hooks()`, which dispatches per CLI:

```
           wta hooks install
                   │
             status + plan
        ┌──────────┼──────────┐
        ▼          ▼          ▼
       skip    install_one  upgrade_one_cli
                   │          │
                   └────┬─────┘
                        ▼
          native install / update / reinstall
```

Reconciliation installs a missing bridge for every detected CLI in scope and
uses each CLI's own update command for an existing stale bridge, because a
second `install` is a no-op once the plugin is registered.
`wta hooks install --force` bypasses this plan and reruns the first-install
flow as a manual recovery path when status cannot observe the real problem.

OpenCode has no separate hook marketplace. `wta hooks install --cli opencode`
copies `wt-agent-hooks.js` into `%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%\opencode\plugins\` when
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, or `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\plugins\`
otherwise. It keeps its ownership/version manifest in a dedicated
`wt-agent-hooks\` support subdirectory and refuses to overwrite a same-name
JavaScript plugin that does not contain Intelligent Terminal's managed-file
marker.

Bundle resolution chain (first hit wins, see
`agent_hooks_installer::bundle::candidate_roots`):

1. `WTA_HOOKS_BUNDLE_DIR` env var — explicit override (highest priority).
2. `<dir-of-current-exe>/wt-agent-hooks/` — where MSIX deposits the bundle
   next to `wta.exe` (configured by `CascadiaPackage.wapproj`'s Content glob).
3. Walk parents of `current_exe()` looking for `tools/wta/wt-agent-hooks/` —
   dev-tree fallback.
4. Materialize the embedded `include_str!` blobs into
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal\hook-bundle-fallback\<cli>\` —
   last-resort safety net for "MSIX layout changed and we forgot to update
   `candidate_roots`".

## Event vocabulary

WTA normalises hook events from all supported CLIs into a single set of topic
names. Event vocabularies differ per CLI:

| WTA event topic         | Claude Code            | Copilot CLI            | Gemini CLI       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| `agent.session.start`   | `SessionStart`         | `SessionStart`         | `SessionStart`   |
| `agent.session.end`     | `SessionEnd`           | `SessionEnd`           | `SessionEnd`     |
| `agent.notification`    | `Notification`         | `Notification`         | `Notification`   |
| `agent.prompt.submit`   | `UserPromptSubmit`     | `UserPromptSubmit`     | `BeforeAgent`    |
| `agent.tool.starting`   | *(not subscribed)*     | *(not subscribed)*     | `BeforeTool`     |
| `agent.error`           | `StopFailure`          | `StopFailure`          | *(not emitted)*  |
| `agent.stop`            | `Stop`                 | `Stop`                 | `AfterAgent`     |
| `agent.subagent.stop`   | *(not subscribed)*     | *(not subscribed)*     | *(not emitted)*  |

All event names are validated against each CLI's documented hook catalog.
`StopFailure` is the Claude-documented name for "turn ended due to API
error" — earlier wta builds shipped an undocumented `ErrorOccurred` name
which is no longer used. Gemini's manifest has no native equivalents for
the failure topics, so those rows are silent on Gemini.

Two topics keep a routing arm in `app.rs` that outlives their subscription in
the Claude and Copilot bundles: `agent.subagent.stop`, which no shipped manifest
claims at all, and `agent.tool.starting`, which Gemini still sends as
`BeforeTool` in the table above and OpenCode still sends through the plugin API
described below. The arms stay so a CLI that adds the event later, or a bundle a
user installed earlier, is routed rather than mis-handled.

**Tool-completion events are deliberately not subscribed.** `app.rs` discards
`agent.tool.finished` / `agent.tool.failed`: tool completion does not end a
turn, so `agent.stop` owns the transition back to Idle. Subscribing them cost a
shell spawn plus a COM round trip *per tool call*, only to be dropped — so
Copilot's `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure`, Gemini's `AfterTool`, and
OpenCode's `tool.execute.after` were removed. The routing arm remains so an
older installed bundle that still emits them is ignored rather than mis-routed.

**Copilot's `PreToolUse` went the same way, one release later** — note this is
narrower than the rule above: `agent.tool.starting` is still subscribed by
Gemini (`BeforeTool`) and OpenCode (`tool.execute.before`), and `app.rs` still
routes it. Copilot kept it for the Attention path `app.rs` synthesizes when
`tool_name` names a user-input tool, which was the only signal available while
Copilot's `Notification` hook did not cover questions. It does now: on 1.0.81-2
a single `AskUserQuestion` produces both the tool hook and a `Notification`,
~0.9 s apart, each carrying the question text. Measured cost of the duplicate
was ~536 ms per tool call — ~388 ms of it `pwsh` startup — on a **fail-closed**
hook, so the CLI blocks on it. Turn-level Working is unaffected because
`UserPromptSubmit` already maps to `ToolStarting`; what is given up is the
tool's name in the session row, not its status.

OpenCode uses its V1 plugin API rather than a hook manifest. The plugin maps
`session.created/updated`, `chat.message`, `tool.execute.before`,
`permission.*`, `question.*`, `session.idle/error/deleted`, and `dispose` to
the same WTA topics. Child sessions with `parentID` are ignored so OpenCode's
internal subagents do not create extra rows.

## Hook bridge

```
Agent CLI ─── hook fires ──▶ wtcli agent-hook ──▶ WTA
                             (stdin JSON + COM)
```

The native bridge reads the hook JSON from stdin and wraps it as
`{cli_source: <claude|codex|copilot|gemini|opencode>, agent_session_id: <sid>, payload: <hook_data>}`,
then publish an `agent_event` through Terminal's COM protocol. The `cli_source`
field is hard-coded per CLI in `hooks.json`; env-var heuristics are unreliable
because Copilot CLI inherits Claude's plugin shape and sets
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, making it indistinguishable from a real Claude run.

`wtcli agent-hook` requires `WT_COM_CLSID` and `WT_SESSION`, writes nothing, and
always exits successfully. The shared ACP process has no `WT_SESSION`, so its
redundant hooks are dropped and cannot be incorrectly attributed to the active
shell pane.

**The `command` field must stay shell-agnostic.** Each CLI decides for itself
which shell interprets that string. That choice is undocumented, differs per
CLI, and we guessed it wrong twice — so the bundle assumes nothing and ships one
spelling that survives all of them:

```
wtcli.exe agent-hook --cli-source <cli> --event <topic>
```

A bare executable name with plain arguments: nothing for PowerShell to read as
an expression, no `cmd.exe` metacharacters, and nothing bash rewrites.

| CLI | Hook shell | How we know |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copilot | PowerShell 7+ | GitHub hooks documentation |
| Codex | PowerShell | sandbox log dispatches every command as `pwsh.exe -NoProfile -Command` |
| Gemini | PowerShell | `hookRunner.ts` → `getShellConfiguration()` resolves ComSpec-powershell → `pwsh.exe` → `powershell.exe`, with no `cmd.exe` branch |
| Claude | **bash** (`/usr/bin/bash`) | its own debug log reports `/usr/bin/bash: line 1: …` |

Spellings that were tried and failed, each in a shell that had not been
considered at the time:

| Spelling | Fails in | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"<path>/agent-hook.cmd" …` | PowerShell | a leading quoted string is an expression, so the words after it are a parse error |
| `& "<path>/agent-hook.cmd" …` | `cmd.exe` | `&` is a command separator with nothing before it — and this one still *parses* in PowerShell, which is what made it look correct |
| `cmd /c "wtcli.exe … & exit 0"` | **bash** | MSYS path conversion rewrites `/c`, so `cmd.exe` launches interactively, prints its banner, echoes the hook payload, and never runs the bridge — while still exiting 0, so the CLI reports the hook as successful |

That last row is why `agent_hooks_installer_tests` executes every shipped
command under PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, **and** bash rather than reasoning about
which shell each CLI uses. Exit status alone is not enough evidence that a hook
worked.

### Surviving an Intelligent Terminal uninstall

`wtcli.exe` reaches `PATH` through the MSIX app-execution alias, which uninstall
deletes — but the hook config stays registered with each CLI. From that moment
the *shell*, not the bridge, decides the hook's exit code, and a missing command
makes it 1. Copilot's `preToolUse` hook is fail-closed, so every tool call in
every later session is denied:

```
✗ Echo a probe marker string (shell)
  └ Denied by preToolUse hook from "…" (hook errored)
```

The fix does not require guessing a shell after all. Copilot's command hooks
take **`powershell` and `bash` fields**, and measurement shows the field name
*selects* the interpreter rather than merely matching a fixed one: with only
`bash` present the events still arrive on Windows, which could not happen if
Copilot always used PowerShell — `command -v` short-circuits there and the
bridge would never run. Each spelling therefore only has to be valid in the one
shell that names it:

| Field | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `powershell` | `try { wtcli.exe agent-hook --cli-source copilot --event <topic> } catch { }; exit 0` |
| `bash` | `command -v wtcli.exe >/dev/null 2>&1 && wtcli.exe agent-hook --cli-source copilot --event <topic>; exit 0` |
| `command` | **not shipped** — see below |

`try`/`catch` is what makes the PowerShell form work: a missing native command
raises a catchable `CommandNotFoundException`, and the trailing `exit 0`
overrides a non-zero exit from the bridge itself. Both keep passing the hook
JSON on stdin, since PowerShell hands its own stdin to the native child.

### Why Copilot ships no `command` at all

A portable `command` cannot be guarded: no single spelling both runs in every
shell and survives a missing bridge (the `cmd /c "… & exit 0"` form is
self-guarding but is destroyed by bash's MSYS path conversion, which rewrites
`/c` into a Windows path so `cmd.exe` starts interactively and never runs the
bridge — and that happens whether or not the bridge exists). Shipping an
unguarded fallback next to a **fail-closed** `preToolUse` hook leaves a path
that only has to be taken once to deny every tool call for the rest of a
session.

Measured on Copilot CLI 1.0.81-0, one field at a time, with delivery as the
oracle:

| Fields present | Events delivered | Tool calls denied |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `powershell` only | 5 | no |
| `bash` only | 5 | no |
| `command` only | 5 | no |
| none | **0** | **no** |

The last row is the one that decides it: a handler with nothing runnable is a
silent no-op, not an error. So dropping `command` costs nothing today — the
per-shell fields deliver exactly as before — and if a future Copilot ever stops
honouring those fields, the hook degrades fail-**open** (no events) instead of
fail-closed (no tools).

Verified against Copilot CLI 1.0.81-0: the bare spelling denies tool calls once
the bridge is missing, and the per-shell fields do not. `timeoutSec: 5` bounds
the other fail-closed edge — a hung COM call — and a hook *timeout* was measured
to be fail-open, so shortening it only reduces the stall.

Claude has no `powershell` / `bash` field pair, but it does document a `shell`
field accepting `"bash"` or `"powershell"`, so it pins the shell and guards
inside `command` instead:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "command -v wtcli.exe >/dev/null 2>&1 && wtcli.exe agent-hook --cli-source claude --event <topic>; exit 0",
  "shell": "bash"
}
```

Pinning is what makes this safe. Claude defaults to bash but falls back to
PowerShell when Git Bash is absent, and a guard written for the wrong shell is
noisy *even when the bridge is present* — measured both ways — so the guard and
the `shell` field have to agree. bash is also the cheaper of the two to start
(~62 ms versus ~380 ms for PowerShell).

Gemini has neither field pair, but it does not need one: its
`getShellConfiguration()` has no non-PowerShell branch on Windows — a
PowerShell `ComSpec`, then `pwsh.exe`, then a `powershell.exe` fallback, all
three returning `shell: "powershell"`. That single-shell guarantee makes it safe
to write the PowerShell guard straight into `command`:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "try { wtcli.exe agent-hook --cli-source gemini --event <topic> } catch { }; exit 0"
}
```

Codex has neither field pair nor a `shell` field either, and needs the same
PowerShell guard as Gemini:

```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "try { wtcli.exe agent-hook --cli-source codex --event <topic> } catch { }; exit 0"
}
```

Codex shipped the bare spelling until 0.1.5, on the theory that its marketplace
entry points at the package directory, so an uninstall would take the plugin
with it and the hook would never load. A manual run disproved that: Codex keeps
its own copy under `~/.codex/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`,
outside the package, and `enabled = true` plus the trusted hashes stay in
`~/.codex/config.toml`. With the bridge gone the hooks still load, still run,
and Codex reports every one of them in the conversation:

```text
• UserPromptSubmit hook (failed)
  error: hook exited with code 1
```

That exit code is also what settles the shell. An unresolvable command exits 1
under PowerShell, 9009 under `cmd.exe`, and 127 under bash, which confirms the
`pwsh.exe -NoProfile -Command` dispatch already recorded in the shell table
above — so the guard is written for PowerShell rather than guessed.

Current state with the bridge missing:

| CLI | Mechanism | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copilot | `powershell` / `bash` fields, no bare `command` | exit 0, silent |
| Claude | `shell: "bash"` + `command -v` guard | exit 0, silent |
| Gemini | PowerShell guard in `command` | exit 0, silent |
| Codex | PowerShell guard in `command` | exit 0, silent |
| OpenCode | JS `try`/`catch`, output ignored | exit 0, silent |

OpenCode needs none of this: its plugin spawns `wtcli.exe` through an argv array
rather than a shell string, already gates on `WT_COM_CLSID` / `WT_SESSION`,
ignores both output streams, and wraps the spawn in `try`/`catch`.

## Manual install (for testing without `wta` startup)

The auto-installer in `wta` is the supported path. For ad-hoc testing
against a freshly cloned repo:

```powershell
# Claude
claude plugin marketplace add .\wta\wt-agent-hooks\claude
claude plugin install wt-agent-hooks@wt-local

# Copilot
copilot plugin marketplace add .\wta\wt-agent-hooks\copilot
copilot plugin install wt-agent-hooks@wt-local

# Gemini
gemini extensions install .\wta\wt-agent-hooks\gemini-extension

# OpenCode (managed copy into ~/.config/opencode/plugins)
wta hooks install --cli opencode
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                          | Where to look                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hooks not firing (Claude)        | `~/.claude/logs/*.log` (or `claude --debug`); search for `hook` / `wt-agent-hooks`.         |
| Hooks not firing (Copilot)       | `~/.copilot/logs/process-*.log`; verify `Loaded N hook(s) from M plugin(s)`.                |
| Hooks not firing (Gemini)        | `~/.gemini/logs/*.log` and `gemini extensions list`.                                        |
| Hooks not firing (OpenCode)      | `hook-trace.log` in the WTA log directory — the plugin records every spawn failure there. A present, correct `wt-agent-hooks.js` proves nothing on its own: the plugin spawns `wtcli` by argv, so it cannot resolve the MSIX app-execution alias on `PATH` and depends on the injected `WTCLI_PATH`. |
| Events not reaching WTA          | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal\logs\wta-ensure-host.log` — search for `agent_event`.   |
| Wrong `cli_source` reported      | Check `hooks.json` in the installed plugin folder — every command must contain `--cli-source <name>`. |

## Marketplace layouts

Claude uses its native `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` sentinels. Copilot uses its native
`.github/plugin/marketplace.json` location and a root-level `plugin.json`.
Both marketplaces declare `"source": "./wt-agent-hooks"`, so each CLI copies
the self-contained inner plugin folder into its writable plugin directory.
Gemini has no marketplace concept and reads the extension folder directly.

## Caveats

- **ACP modes may invoke plugin hooks.** `wtcli agent-hook` ignores invocations
  without `WT_SESSION`, including WTA's shared ACP processes. Agent-pane
  sessions are already tracked through ACP; only interactive CLI sessions in
  regular terminal panes produce hook-backed rows.
- **OpenCode ACP sessions are intentionally ignored by the plugin.** The
  plugin requires both `WT_COM_CLSID` and `WT_SESSION`; the shared ACP process
  used by the agent pane is already tracked through ACP and must not create a
  duplicate hook-backed row.
- **MSIX install paths include the package version.** They change on every
  upgrade, which is why `agent_hooks_installer` re-runs marketplace
  registration on every wta startup and strips stale entries before
  reinstalling.
- **Codex must re-trust the native commands once.** Codex hashes each hook
  command for trust, so replacing the PowerShell command with
  `wtcli agent-hook` requires reviewing the updated plugin through `/hooks`.
  The hashes are taken over the command string, not the bundle version, so a
  later version bump that leaves Codex's commands alone does not ask again.
