## What is Intelligent Terminal?

Intelligent Terminal is an experimental fork of [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) with native agent integration.

Intelligent Terminal works with any [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)-compatible](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents) agent CLI. All you need is to install your preferred agent CLI on your PC. If you don't have a preferred agent, we'll get you setup with [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/).

Intelligent Terminal takes all the features you love in Windows Terminal such as:  tabs, profiles, themes, settings, shells, and keyboard shortcuts, which all work the way you expect.

Read the [announcement blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-intelligent-terminal-version-0-1/) for more details.

## Installing and running Intelligent Terminal

> [!NOTE]
> Intelligent Terminal requires Windows 11 22H2 or later (22621.6060+). You also need a supported agent CLI and subscription. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/) is the default.

### Microsoft Store (recommended)

Install the [Intelligent Terminal from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NMQC2SSJX24).
This allows you to always be on the latest version when we release new builds
with automatic upgrades.

### WinGet

[winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) users can download and install
the latest Intelligent Terminal release by installing the `Microsoft.IntelligentTerminal`
package:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.IntelligentTerminal -e
```

### Downloads

| Distribution | Architecture | Link |
|--------------|:------------:|------|
| App Installer | x64, arm64, x86 | [Download](https://github.com/microsoft/intelligent-terminal/releases/latest) |


---

## Get Started

1. On first launch, choose your agent. Intelligent Terminal auto-detects several [ACP-compatible](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents) agent CLIs on your machine (Copilot/Claude/Codex/Gemini). If none are found, it defaults to GitHub Copilot CLI and installs it for you via WinGet.
3. If you aren't already authenticated, the agent pane walks you through sign-in.
4. Start asking questions and using the agent pane for assistance. The agent has context on your shell output, no copy-pasting needed.

> [!TIP]
> If you see "running scripts is disabled on this system" or an `UnauthorizedAccess` error in PowerShell, your execution policy is blocking your profile and Intelligent Terminal can't initialize shell integration. Run:
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
> ```
> If you run into any other issues or dependency errors, see [installing-dependencies.md](./doc/installing-dependencies.md).

## Features

### Agent Status Bar

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/intelligent-terminal-status-bar.png" alt="Screenshot of the agent status bar at the bottom of the terminal window">
</p>

The agent status bar sits at the bottom of the window and gives you quick access to everything agent-related. On the left: the agent pane toggle (hotkey: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+.</kbd>) and the error detection icon (hotkey: <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+.</kbd>), which lights up when a fixable error is detected. On the right: the agent management icon (hotkey: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+/</kbd>) that opens your session management panel. It's a persistent, minimal control surface so you're never more than one click away from your agents.

### Agent Pane

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/intelligent-terminal-agent-pane.png" alt="Screenshot of the agent pane with a development conversation">
</p>

A context-aware, docked pane with your agent CLI of choice. The pane has context on your shell output across all your shells. Toggle with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+.</kbd>, switch focus with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd>. If the agent needs to do multiple or complex tasks, it spins up background tasks in new tabs so your active shell stays focused.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/intelligent-terminal-agent-focus.png" alt="Screenshot of the agent pane with focus, showing multiple panes">
</p>

When you have multiple panes active, a small "Agent" indicator will appear on the pane that your agent has "focus" on.

### Agent Management

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/intelligent-terminal-agent-management.png" alt="Screenshot of agent management panel showing active agents and past sessions">
</p>

View all active agents, their status, and past sessions. Pick up a workflow where you left off or check on a long-running task. Click the agent management icon in the status bar or press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+/</kbd> to open it.

### Error Detection

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/intelligent-terminal-error-detection.png" alt="Screenshot of automatic error detection with a suggested fix">
</p>

When a command fails, an indicator appears in the agent status bar. Click it or press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+.</kbd> to open the agent pane with the error context already loaded. The agent can explain what happened and suggest or run a fix. Configure your settings to auto-detect errors only, or to also auto-suggest fixes.

### Command Palette

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/intelligent-terminal-command-palette.png" alt="Screenshot of Command Palette with an agent prompt">
</p>

Type `?` followed by your prompt in the Command Palette to kick off an agent task. Intelligent Terminal injects context from the active pane and starts the agent in a background tab. Use <kbd>Alt+Shift+/</kbd> to jump directly into prompt mode.

## Data & Privacy

Intelligent Terminal is a **local transport layer**. It passes your prompts and shell context to your selected agent CLI over stdio/ACP. Intelligent Terminal does not call any cloud APIs itself and does not persist conversation history, however, diagnostic logs may be written to disk and telemetry may be emitted as described below.

### What data flows through Terminal

- Your prompts (what you type in the agent pane or command palette)
- Shell output context (recent command output shared with the agent for context)
- Basic environment metadata (shell type, OS version)

All of this is held in memory for the active session only and discarded when the session ends.

### Where your data goes depends on your agent CLI

| Agent CLI | Data routing | Terms |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/) (default) | GitHub backend | [GitHub Copilot Trust Center](https://resources.github.com/copilot-trust-center/). Enterprise protections (e.g., zero data retention) apply for eligible plans. |
| Third-party or custom agent CLIs | Determined by the agent vendor | Governed by that vendor's terms, not Microsoft or GitHub agreements. |

> [!NOTE]
> Terminal cannot guarantee data protections for third-party agent CLIs. When you select an agent, you're choosing where your data goes. Review your agent vendor's privacy policy before use. For more information on how to use GitHub Copilot responsibly, see [Responsible use of GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use/copilot-in-windows-terminal).

### Controls

- Choose your agent CLI at any time in Settings > Agent
- Disable auto error detection to prevent shell output from being detected automatically
- Intelligent Terminal always asks before running commands on your behalf in your shell

## Feedback

Intelligent Terminal is in an experimental stage. If you have a feature request or find a bug, [submit an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/intelligent-terminal/issues) on the GitHub repository.

### Collecting Logs

To help us investigate bugs, please collect and attach diagnostic logs when filing an issue:

1. Open Command Palette with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>
2. Search for **Report a bug (collect logs)**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/intelligent-terminal-collect-logs.png" alt="Screenshot of Command Palette showing 'Report a bug (collect logs)' command">
</p>

3. A ZIP file containing your error logs will be generated and opened in File Explorer
4. Attach the ZIP to your issue so we can investigate with full context

Intelligent Terminal ships as a separate app and installs next to your existing Windows Terminal. If you don't want agents in your terminal, nothing changes for you. With this model, we can learn, experiment, and iterate with you, the community, on what this evolution might look like without breaking your existing Windows Terminal flows.
