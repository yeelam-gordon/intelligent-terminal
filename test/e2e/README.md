# ItE2E — Intelligent Terminal End-to-End Test Framework

A robust, CLI-composition test framework that drives and verifies a **deployed
(MSIX-packaged)** Intelligent Terminal. Tests are authored in **PowerShell + Pester 5**.
Design rationale is captured in the inline notes below and in each suite's header comments.

## Release-checklist coverage

The `tests/` folder implements the `[E2E]` items from
`doc/release-check-list.md` that are automatable on one machine. Copilot drives
the baseline suites, while the agent matrix covers other installed and
authenticated ACP agents. Current status (run on the Store package):

| Suite (file) | Covers | Cases |

**Coverage: 155 of 157 automatable `[E2E]` checklist items are implemented.**
**Test status: 135 baseline feature cases pass + 3 documented skips** (`wta sessions list` is
identity-gated — see `Feature.SessionList.Tests.ps1`), plus 2 PR #481 WSL-backend cases and 2
PR #488 delegate-source cases that run only when a runnable distro (and, for the #481 chat
case, an installed+authenticated native agent) is available. The 155 implemented checklist
items map to the baseline cases plus the deterministic settings/persistence assertions. The
remaining new items are the two profile agent picker UIs; they stay explicit E2E work rather
than being falsely credited by the JSON-level runtime tests. Other
environment-dependent items are tracked and auto-skipped when their prerequisite is absent:
**other agent CLIs** (`Feature.AgentMatrix.Tests.ps1` now covers Claude/Codex/Gemini chat,
auth-gated per CLI — each Context runs only when that CLI is installed *and* authenticated,
else skips); custom agents; multi-window drag; hook/CLI install; policy locks; IME/paste; WSL
autofix (needs a dev build with OSC 9001 ShellType + a running distro); WT window-level
keyboard accelerators (command palette / Delegate `Alt+Shift+B` / pane hotkeys — not
injectable via UIA/send-keys in this harness); and manual release-sign-off gates.

Token-consuming simulated-real-user tests are deliberately excluded from this publishable suite
and from CI. They live only in the feature's dev-only local validation harness and run manually
against an exact deployed publish package with explicitly available provider quota.

`tools\AutofixPrompt.Local.Tests.ps1` is an opt-in, quota-consuming Dev validation
of actual Copilot decisions, outside the default `tests`/`selftests` discovery.
It runs three fresh-session samples each of an obvious Git typo and an unfamiliar
local command typo. The oracle inspects session-scoped tool calls: the obvious
typo must go directly to a correction card with no discovery tools, while the
local command must be resolved and its corrected script must run in the source pane.
Run it explicitly through `Invoke-ItE2EReport.ps1 -Path` with `ITE2E_PACKAGE=Dev`
and `ITE2E_EXPECTED_WTA_SHA256` set to the deployed feature build.
`ITE2E_COMMAND_FIXTURE_DIR` must name an existing writable user PATH directory;
the test creates uniquely named scripts there and removes them afterward. This
models an installed local command, rather than assuming a script in the current
directory is on PowerShell's command search path. Set `ITE2E_AUTOFIX_MODEL` to
pin the Copilot model being evaluated. Settings are preserved through ItE2E;
the test does not modify PATH or profiles.

`Feature.AutofixCommandResolution` requires a Debug Dev build so its negative
probe assertions have enabled diagnostic evidence. Store selections (including
the Store package family name) skip this suite during default discovery.
Missing/invalid package selections and Dev build mismatches still fail. Set
`ITE2E_EXPECTED_WTA_SHA256` to the SHA-256 of the feature-branch build when
validating a change; the suite rejects a mismatched deployed binary. Its unique
artifact directory records the package hash, received ACP contracts, query
results, and scoped helper logs. The fixture uses disposable command files and
does not modify the user's PowerShell profile or consume model quota.

## What it gives you

Three planes, all built on self-verifying primitives:

| Plane | Backed by | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Control** | `wtcli` (COM `IProtocolServer`) | panes/tabs, `Send-WtInput`, `Invoke-RunCommand`, `Get-WtCapture`, `Send-WtEvent` |
| **UI** | `winapp ui` (Windows App CLI) | `Invoke-UiElement`, `Set-UiValue`, `Wait-UiElement`, `Save-UiScreenshot` |
| **State/Logs** | settings.json / state.json / versioned logs / event stream | `Set-WtSetting`, `Get-FreCompleted`, `Get-ItLogText`, `Start-WtEventListener` |

…plus verification oracles: `Assert-Setting`, `Assert-Ui`/`Assert-Xaml`,
`Assert-Script`, `Assert-Pane`, `Assert-WtEvent`, `Assert-Log`, and the AI oracle
`Assert-AI` (LLM judge wrapping an agent CLI's print mode, e.g. `copilot -p`).

## Prerequisites

- Windows, **PowerShell 7+**
- **Windows App CLI**: `winget install Microsoft.WinAppCli` (gives `winapp ui`)
- **Pester 5**: `Install-Module Pester -MinimumVersion 5.5.0 -Scope CurrentUser`
- A deployed Intelligent Terminal package (Store `Microsoft.IntelligentTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe`
  or Dev `IntelligentTerminal_rd9vj3e6a2mbr`).
- `Feature.AgentSelectAll` and `Feature.AgentInputNavigation` physical letter-key cases require
  an already loaded English (US) keyboard layout. Each suite activates it only for its own
  verified window/thread and restores the previous layout before closing, so an active IME
  cannot retain the probe text as a composition.

When an action's event is the oracle, start its listener with
`Start-WtEventListener -WaitForReady` before triggering the action. This uses the
subscription handshake rather than a fixed startup delay.

One-shot setup + verify:

```powershell
pwsh -File test/e2e/bootstrap.ps1          # install deps, import module
pwsh -File test/e2e/bootstrap.ps1 -Check   # verify only
```

## Choosing the build: Dev vs Store

Every harness entry point takes a **`-Package`** selector, so a test can target
either the production build or the build you're developing:

| `-Package` | Resolves to | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `Store` | `Microsoft.IntelligentTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe` | The shipped/production package — real user environment. |
| `Dev` | `IntelligentTerminal_rd9vj3e6a2mbr` | A locally **sideloaded** build (e.g. your F5 / `bx` output). Use this to validate a change before it ships. |
| *(explicit PFN)* | the family name you pass | Any other package. |

```powershell
$app = Start-Terminal       -Package Dev    # control/UI tests against the dev build
$app = Start-TerminalFre    -Package Store  # drive the FRE overlay on the store build
```

**Both builds can be installed at once and targeted independently.** The harness
launches via **AUMID** (`shell:AppsFolder\<PackageFamilyName>!App`), which is
package-specific, so `-Package Dev` always hits the dev build even while the
store build is also installed. (The global `wtai` AppExecutionAlias is owned by a
single package and is therefore ambiguous in that scenario — it is kept only as a
last-resort fallback.)

To make a build selectable:
- **Dev**: build + deploy it once, e.g. `cd src/cascadia/CascadiaPackage; bx` then
  `DeployAppRecipe.exe bin\x64\Debug\CascadiaPackage.build.appxrecipe`.
- **Store**: install the shipped MSIX.

A suite that asserts on diagnostics only present in a particular build should pin
its `-Package` and **`-Skip`** itself when that package isn't installed (see
`Feature.FreExecutionPolicy.Tests.ps1`, which targets `Dev` and skips when the
dev package is absent — keeping CI green on machines that only have the store build).

## Running the self-tests

```powershell
Import-Module Pester
Invoke-Pester test/e2e/selftests -Tag Unit    # hermetic, no terminal needed
Invoke-Pester test/e2e/selftests -Tag Live    # launches/closes the real terminal
Invoke-Pester test/e2e/selftests -Tag AI      # AI oracle (needs an agent CLI, e.g. copilot)
Invoke-Pester test/e2e/selftests -Tag Agent   # agent pane + autofix (needs copilot auth)
Invoke-Pester test/e2e/selftests              # everything (30 tests)
```

The self-tests are the framework's own proof: every primitive is exercised against a
running terminal (`selftests/ItE2E.Live.Tests.ps1`) and the core helpers are unit-tested
in `selftests/ItE2E.Unit.Tests.ps1` (hermetic, no terminal needed).

## Pane-context performance benchmark

`Measure-PaneContext.ps1` measures issue #838's **wtcli subprocess → COM →
capture** boundary, without sending an agent prompt or consuming model tokens.
It attaches to **already running**, explicitly selected Dev/Store/PFN packages and
existing pane GUIDs. It never launches/closes Terminal, changes settings/focus,
creates fixtures, or types into panes. Package-local binaries and a readable
package manifest are required; it does not use an ambiguous `wtcli` PATH alias
or probe other brands' COM servers. Dependencies: Windows, PowerShell **7.2+**,
Git, and a deployed package supporting `get-pane-context`. Neither WinApp CLI,
agent authentication, nor Pester is needed for the benchmark itself.

First prepare stable terminal output yourself, and obtain the existing pane's
`session_id` through the harness/package-specific `wtcli`. Run the benchmark
from a **separate process/pane**, not the pane being measured. Leave its content,
focus, window/tab layout, and package binaries unchanged until completion:

```powershell
$env:ITE2E_PACKAGE = 'Dev'
pwsh -NoProfile -File test\e2e\bootstrap.ps1 -Check

# Replace the GUID and marker with those of an existing, settled marked pane.
# Planner/ManualFix require this to remain the resolved active working pane.
pwsh -NoProfile -File test\e2e\Measure-PaneContext.ps1 `
    -Package Dev -Configuration Debug -Mode Planner `
    -TargetPaneId '11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555' `
    -Scenario 'marked-short' -ExpectedMarks Marked -ExpectedMarker 'BENCH-DONE' `
    -Warmup 5 -Samples 40 -OutDir test\e2e\artifacts\pane-context-benchmark\debug-marked-planner

# ExplicitAutofix can target an unfocused pane; no focus change is performed.
pwsh -NoProfile -File test\e2e\Measure-PaneContext.ps1 `
    -Package Dev -Configuration Debug -Mode ExplicitAutofix `
    -TargetPaneId '11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555' `
    -Scenario 'unmarked-long-scrollback' -ExpectedMarks Unmarked `
    -OutDir test\e2e\artifacts\pane-context-benchmark\debug-unmarked-autofix
```

`-Package`, `-Configuration` (a label, not a build action), `-Mode`,
`-TargetPaneId`, `-Scenario`, and `-OutDir` are mandatory; `Auto` is rejected.
`ExplicitAutofix` also accepts an array of existing pane IDs when called from
PowerShell with `& .\test\e2e\Measure-PaneContext.ps1 ... -TargetPaneId @($id1, $id2)`.
Each pane gets its own paired measurements. Use distinct output directories
under ignored `test\e2e\artifacts`; existing result files are never overwritten.
Run marked, unmarked, and long-scrollback scenarios separately and label them
honestly. For optional `-ExpectedMarker`, choose text that survives **both**
paths' intentional bounds.

### Baseline and interpretation

- The baseline is a source-faithful PowerShell reproduction of the collector at
  `db609f8061f81c2eb9a4bdaf3e0666392596bce4` (HEAD when #838 was restored),
  pinned in the script. Its `prompt_context.rs` is retrieved with `git show` for
  provenance. **That planner already used marks**, not a buffer-only read.
- `Planner`: `active-pane` → `capture-pane --last-prompt` → optional
  `capture-pane -l 24`. `ManualFix` uses the same sequence with 30 fallback lines.
  `ExplicitAutofix` preserves the old **unconditional active-pane query**, then
  walks windows → tabs → panes until the exact source GUID is found, followed by
  marked capture / 30-line fallback. Enumeration cost depends on target position
  and topology. Errors abort instead of being silently turned into samples.
- No unsupported-capability request is added to the legacy baseline. The new
  path uses **one** `get-pane-context --max-lines 24|30 --max-chars 4000`
  subprocess (with `--target` only for explicit autofix). Its normal
  authentication/capability negotiation remains inside that subprocess.
- Legacy read methods still capture first and trim locally; the benchmark does
  not retrofit bounded capture into them. Both paths use a 4000-Unicode-scalar
  content budget, but **legacy marked output has no line cap**, while new marked
  output also observes 24/30 lines. For oversized unmarked output, new capture
  keeps a scalar **tail** versus legacy's scalar **prefix** of its line tail.
  Legacy also ignores the read result's truncation flag. WTA's
  `\n...<truncated>` prompt suffix is outside the content budget. Therefore exact
  cross-path payload equality is **reported, not asserted**.
- The same transport runs both paths: `.NET ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList`,
  no shell, UTF-8, concurrent asynchronous stdout/stderr reads, closed stdin,
  normal authentication and a shared per-command timeout (default 20 seconds).
  The existing harness also uses asynchronous process waits, not polling; the
  benchmark-specific transport adds precise timing and one deadline covering
  both process exit and pipe EOF, and fails loudly on parse/read/exit errors.
- Each pane runs at least five warmup pairs, then at least 40 recorded pairs,
  alternating legacy-first/new-first order. Primary `BoundaryMs` is the **sum
  of process-start-to-exit-and-EOF durations**, excluding PowerShell parsing,
  assertions and report writes. Secondary `CollectorMs` includes PowerShell
  emulation overhead and is **not** a native Rust collector measurement.
  Warmups are exported but excluded from statistics. p50/p95 use nearest rank;
  speedup is `legacy/new`, reduction is `100*(1-new/legacy)`, including regressions.
- Output must resolve to the requested pane with matching shell/cwd/process
  metadata, valid Unicode/bounds, consistent mark/source metadata, and an optional
  literal marker. Each path's payload/metadata fingerprint must stay stable.
  Different payload hashes across paths may be expected from the bounds above.

Artifacts are `samples.csv` (raw paired samples, bytes, hashes, marks, bounds),
`requests.csv` (individual subprocess commands/timings/response bytes),
`metadata.json` (written before measurement), and `summary.json` (written **only
after complete validation**). Summaries include per-path request counts,
nearest-rank p50/p95, speedups/reductions, byte metrics, payload equality,
package version/CLSID, deployed binary hashes/versions, process identity, source
revision/dirty status/diff hash, and benchmark source hashes. Raw terminal text
is not saved, but pane IDs/paths and the optional marker are; keep artifacts local.
A failed run may retain partial CSVs but has no success summary.

**Scope:** this isolates old versus new **context collection on the same new
server**, not old/new application binaries and not full prompt/LLM latency.
Subprocess counts are not COM-call counts. Configuration labels and source
hashes alone cannot prove a deployment came from that revision: the operator
must build/deploy the intended code and compare packaged binary hashes.
Debug and Release results are not interchangeable. Busy UI threads, antivirus,
background output and changing topology can affect measurements; repeat runs.

Hermetic benchmark tests (no app launches or installs):

```powershell
Invoke-Pester test\e2e\selftests\PaneContextBenchmark.Unit.Tests.ps1 -Output Detailed
```

## Reports (HTML + precise per-failure diagnostics)

`Invoke-ItE2EReport.ps1` wraps Pester and, by default, writes the report to the **fixed
in-repo path `test/e2e/artifacts/`** (override with `-OutDir`; the dir is git-ignored):

```powershell
pwsh -File test/e2e/Invoke-ItE2EReport.ps1                 # full suite -> test/e2e/artifacts/
pwsh -File test/e2e/Invoke-ItE2EReport.ps1 -Tag Feature
pwsh -File test/e2e/Invoke-ItE2EReport.ps1 -Path test/e2e/tests/Feature.AutofixPane.Tests.ps1
```

Outputs (all under `test/e2e/artifacts/`):
- `report.html` — **self-contained HTML** (open in a browser): green/red pass-fail banner,
  total/passed/failed/skipped stat cards, one **failure card** per failed test (exact error,
  `file:line` of the failing assertion, duration, clickable artifact links + inline screenshot
  thumbnails), and a full results table grouped by `Describe > Context`.
- `results.xml` — **NUnit XML** for CI test reporting (Azure DevOps / GitHub).
- `summary.md` — Markdown: one block per **failed** test with the **exact error**, **file:line**,
  and any **artifact paths** (screenshots saved by `Assert-Ui`/`Assert-AgentPaneText`, log slices).
- `release-report.md` — the **clean, jargon-free release checklist**, auto-generated as the final
  step from `doc/release-check-list.md` + this run's `results.xml` (via `New-ReleaseReport.ps1`).
  Every coverage tag (`[UT✓]`/`[E2E]`/`[MANUAL]`) and `_(UT: …)_` note is stripped, and each box is
  driven purely by automation: **`[x]`** = a test passed, **`[ ] ⚠️ AUTOMATION FAILED`** = a test ran
  and failed, plain **`[ ]`** = not covered this run, verify manually. Suppress with
  `-SkipReleaseReport`; regenerate standalone from an existing `results.xml` with
  `pwsh -File test/e2e/New-ReleaseReport.ps1`. Items listed in `test/e2e/release-exclude.psd1`
  (by title regex, e.g. RTL) are dropped from the report to keep it focused on the sign-off set.

  **Stable item IDs (`C001`, `C002`, …).** Every checkbox item in `doc/release-check-list.md`
  carries a stable ID right after the box, and the generators carry it verbatim into
  `release-report.md` — so you can refer to a case by number ("C136 is failing") and it means the
  same item in both files. Assign/refresh IDs with `pwsh -File test/e2e/Set-ChecklistIds.ps1`
  (idempotent: existing IDs are never renumbered; a newly-added item gets the next free number).

  **Incremental update (no full-suite re-run needed).** `New-ReleaseReport.ps1` regenerates the
  whole report, so a single-suite run would blank every item it didn't cover. To refresh just the
  rows a partial run touched, use `Update-ReleaseReport.ps1`, which takes the EXISTING
  `release-report.md` as the source of truth and overlays only this run's results: a covered item
  that **passed** becomes `[x]`, one that **failed** becomes `[ ] ⚠️ AUTOMATION FAILED`, a covered
  item that only **skipped** is left unchanged (a flaky skip never un-ticks a prior pass), and every
  item **out of scope** for the run is preserved exactly. One-liner via the runner:
  `pwsh -File test/e2e/Invoke-ItE2EReport.ps1 -Path test/e2e/tests/Feature.Delegate.Tests.ps1 -UpdateReport`
  (runs the suite, then overlays only its items onto the existing report; falls back to a fresh
  generate if no report exists yet). Or standalone after a run wrote `results.xml`:
  `pwsh -File test/e2e/Update-ReleaseReport.ps1`.
- Console echo of the same precise failures; exit code `1` on any failure (CI-friendly).

Every failure is precise because each `Assert-*` throws a descriptive message — e.g.
`Assert-Pane: pane <id> never matched /git status/ within 12s. Screenshot: <path>` or
`Assert-AI FAILED: '<claim>' -> <reason> (confidence=0.7)` — and Pester records the exact
`Should` line and `file:line`.
(`selftests/ItE2E.Unit.Tests.ps1`, incl. a regression test for output truncation).

## Authoring a test

```powershell
Describe 'Agent pane' -Tag 'Live' {
    BeforeAll {
        Import-Module test/e2e/ItE2E/ItE2E.psd1 -Force
        $script:app = Start-Terminal -Package Store -Settings @{ acpAgent = 'copilot' }
    }
    AfterAll { Stop-Terminal -App $script:app }   # restores settings/state

    It 'opens the agent pane from the bottom bar' {
        Open-AgentPane -App $script:app
        Assert-Ui -App $script:app -Selector 'AgentToggleButton'
        Test-AgentPaneOpen -App $script:app | Should -BeTrue
    }
}
```

`Start-Terminal` requires an explicit package, backs up `settings.json`/`state.json`, marks the
FRE complete, applies your settings, launches the app, brings COM online (probes the
per-brand `WT_COM_CLSID`), and resolves the window HWND. `Stop-Terminal` closes it and
restores the backup.

> **Picking the build**: pass `-Package Dev` / `-Package Store` — see

## How it works (key facts)

- **COM discovery**: `wtcli` reaches WT through the per-brand CLSID in `WT_COM_CLSID`
  (braced, e.g. `{A2E4F6B8-...}` for Release). The harness probes the four brand CLSIDs
  against a *running* terminal until one connects (the server is registered with
  `CoRegisterClassObject(CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER)`, so WT must already be up). The co-located
  `wtcli.exe` in the package install dir connects fine without needing the AppExecutionAlias.
- **FRE**: completion is the `agentFreCompleted` flag in the shared `state.json`;
  `Invoke-FrePass` sets it instantly.
- **Settings**: the AI keys (`acpAgent`, `autoFixEnabled`, `agentPanePosition`,
  `aiIntegration.coordinator.enabled`, …) are *top-level* properties whose names contain
  dots. `Set-WtSetting` patches them and waits for the on-disk write.
- **UI selectors**: prefer XAML `AutomationProperties.AutomationId` (confirmed present:
  `AgentToggleButton`, `SessionToggleButton`, `NewTabButton`, `NextButton`, `SaveButton`).
  `winapp ui` also accepts generated slugs and plain text.
- **Agent pane** is a XAML `AgentPaneContent` area — **NOT** a wtcli/protocol pane (it does
  not appear in `list-panes` and has no protocol session_id). Detect it by the UI element
  `AgentLabelText` (`Test-AgentPaneOpen`), open/close it via the `AgentToggleButton`.
- **Events**: `Start-WtEventListener` runs `wtcli listen --json` and buffers events. The
  envelope is `{ "method": "<name>", "params": {...}, "type": "event" }` — the event **name
  is `.method`** (`vt_sequence`, `agent_event`, …), and `.type` is *always* `"event"`. Start
  the listener *before* the triggering action, then `Wait-WtEvent`/`Assert-WtEvent`.
- **Autofix signals**: a failed command emits `method=vt_sequence, params.sequence ~
  "osc:133;D;<nonzero>"` (`Wait-WtCommandFailure`); autofix then submits a prompt observable
  as `method=agent_event` whose `params.payload.initial_prompt` contains "A command failed.
  Diagnose…" — note this rides on the `agent.session.start` sub-event, not `agent.prompt.submit`
  (`Wait-Autofix`). This build emits no dedicated `autofix_state` event. Autofix **de-dupes
  repeated identical failures**, so tests use a unique bogus command each time.

## Limitations

- **`Get-WtSessions`** runs `wta.exe`, but the *packaged* `wta.exe` cannot be launched by
  an external process (Access denied) and an *unpackaged* copy resolves the wrong
  (non-package-private) runtime paths, so it can't find the in-package master. This
  feature needs to run inside a WT pane with package identity; it's gated behind `-Tag
  Live`.
- The **AI oracle (`Assert-AI`)** wraps an agent CLI's non-interactive print mode
  (`copilot -p`, `claude -p`, …) **directly** — it is independent of wta and needs only an
  authenticated agent CLI on PATH (override with `$env:ITE2E_AI_AGENT`). Gated behind
  `-Tag AI`.
- Multiple WT windows of the same package share one process (single-instance
  `WindowEmperor`); the harness targets by PID + HWND.
