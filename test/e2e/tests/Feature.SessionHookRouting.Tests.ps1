# Release checklist section 8 (C296, C297, C298) - how one agent hook is routed
# from `wtcli` directly into the master session registry.
#
# Why these live at E2E rather than in a unit test: the WTA unit tests exercise one
# helper's routing function and the master's handler in isolation, inside a single
# process. The defect only exists at the real process boundary: one
# `wtcli agent-hook` invocation becomes one COM broadcast that reaches master AND
# every helper. Master must route its own copy exactly once while helpers update
# only their local pane bindings; if a helper forwards, the old N-times
# amplification returns.
