# Intelligent Terminal (Windows Terminal Fork)

AI-native Windows Terminal — agents (Copilot, Claude, Gemini, custom) can understand, fix, and automate terminal workflows.

## Core Components

- **WTA** (Windows Terminal Agent) — orchestrator binary. Launches agents, passes Terminal Protocol connection info. Agents control WT via `wtcli`.
  - Launch: `wta delegate --agent <agent> --delegate-agent <delegate> --cwd <cwd> "<prompt>"`
- **WT Protocol** (`IProtocolServer`) — sole integration surface. WinRT IDL + COM out-of-process server (MBM marshaling, MTA thread). Discovery via `WT_COM_CLSID` env var.
  - IDL: `src/cascadia/TerminalProtocol/TerminalProtocol.idl`
  - Server: `src/cascadia/WindowsTerminal/TerminalProtocolComServer.cpp`
- **WTCLI** — CLI client consuming `IProtocolServer` via `CoCreateInstance(CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER)`. Agents shell out to `wtcli list-panes`, `wtcli capture-pane`, etc.
- **ACP** (Agent Control Protocol) — JSON-RPC 2.0 spoken inside the helper+master architecture. `wta-helper` ↔ `wta-master` over a named pipe; `wta-master` ↔ agent CLI subprocess over stdio. The C++ side no longer participates in ACP directly — agent panes are plain `ConptyConnection`s hosting a `wta-helper` child. See `doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md`.

## UX

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `>Toggle AI assistant` | Opens/toggles agent pane (`openAgentPane` action) |
| `?<prompt>` | Delegates to hidden background WTA process |
| `?` (empty) | No-op |
| `&` | Background task mode (future, C9) |

Agent pane: position configurable (`bottom`/`right`/`top`/`left`). Color-coded VT output.

```

## Architecture

```
WindowEmperor (one WT process, N AppHosts/windows)
  |-- TerminalProtocolComServer (COM, MTA thread, WT_COM_CLSID)
  |-- SharedWta (singleton) -- spawns --> wta-master ──► agent CLI (ACP/stdio)
  |                                          ▲
  |                                          │ ACP/JSON-RPC over named pipe
  +-- AppHost[] → TerminalWindow → TerminalPage
        |-- CommandPalette (? / & prefixes)
        |-- Per-tab agent pane: ConptyConnection ───► wta-helper (conpty child)
        |                                            (one helper per tab, pre-warmed)
        +-- Protocol bridge (TerminalPage.Protocol.cpp)

External: Agent → wtcli → COM (IProtocolServer) → TerminalProtocolComServer → WindowEmperor
```

**Per-tab + per-window routing.** Each agent pane has its own helper bound
to an `owner_tab_id` (= WT tab StableId) and a `window_id`. All inbound
events that mutate per-tab state (`set_agent_state`, `tab_changed`,
`tab_closed`, `tab_renamed`) carry both ids; helpers filter by `window_id`
and (for `tab_changed`) by owner-lock in `switch_tab_session`. Outbound
helper events (`agent_state_changed`, `agent_status`, `autofix_state`,
`close_agent_pane`) carry `tab_id` so C++ can route via
`_FindTabByStableId` instead of fanning out across every pane / window.
See `doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md` §7.

**Helper is pre-warmed per tab.** Every new tab spawns a stashed agent
pane on creation (`_InitializeTab` → `_AutoCreateHiddenAgentPaneShared`
with `autoStash=true`, `--start-stashed`), so the helper is running and
its ACP session connects in the background from the start — even if the
user never opens the pane. This is what lets autofix work on a tab the
user hasn't interacted with. The agent CLI itself is spawned once by
`wta-master` at startup and shared across all helpers (each helper's
`initialize` is a cached replay; only `session/new` round-trips to the
CLI). `--start-stashed` only seeds `pane_open=false`; it does not defer
the handshake. The pre-warm is skipped when wta is unavailable, GPO
blocks all agents, or the tab arrived with an agent pane via cross-window
drag-in (`agentLeavesSeen > 0`). See `TabManagement.cpp:366`.

**Agent pane toggle = stash, not destroy.** `Ctrl+Shift+.` /
`Ctrl+Shift+/` / the bottom-bar button toggle via
`Tab::StashAgentPane`/`RestoreStashedAgentPane` (built on WT's
`Pane::HidePane`/`RestorePane`). Helper + conpty + ACP session + chat
history all survive the toggle. The pane is only destroyed on tab close
or `Ctrl+C×2` in the TUI. See spec §8.

## Autofix

Detects command failures in other panes and auto-suggests fixes via the agent.

**Pipeline**: Shell emits `OSC 133;D;<exit_code>` → `TerminalPage` raises `ProtocolVtSequenceReceived` → COM server forwards to clients → WTA (via `wtcli listen --json`) classifies → `maybe_trigger_autofix()`.

**Requirements**: PowerShell shell integration (OSC 133 marks), a helper
whose ACP session has reached `Connected`, `wtcli` on PATH. The pane does
**not** need to be visible — the per-tab pre-warmed helper (see
Architecture) makes autofix work on a stashed pane. But a failure that
lands before the helper's session connects (cold start of master/agent
CLI, in-flight `session/new`, or a `Failed` agent) is **dropped**:
`trigger_autofix_inner` early-returns when `state != Connected`
(`app.rs:6820`). The bottom-bar notification banner still shows; only the
autofix pill / LLM call is skipped, and the failure is not re-triggered
once the session later connects.

**Key code**: `tools/wta/src/app.rs` (`classify_wt_event`, `maybe_trigger_autofix`), `TerminalPage.cpp:2650-2740` (event handlers), `TerminalProtocolComServer.cpp` (`_ensurePageEventsRegistered`).

**Diag log**: `wta-ensure-host.log` in the WTA log directory — shows event flow, classification, and autofix triggers.

## Hooks plugin auto-upgrade

When IT is installed or upgraded, the bundled `wt-agent-hooks` plugin
(`tools/wta/wt-agent-hooks/{copilot,claude,gemini-extension}/`) needs to
re-land into any agent CLI the user already opted into (via Settings UI /
FRE "Install hooks" or `wta hooks install`). This is handled silently by
`agent_hooks_installer::upgrade_installed_hooks`, fired once per
`wta-master` startup on a blocking-pool thread.

**Trigger model — bundle version is the upgrade signal.** A tiny state
file `<LocalCache>/IntelligentTerminal/hooks-upgrade-state.json` records
the bundle version this wta process last saw per CLI. At startup we read
each CLI's bundle `plugin.json` / `gemini-extension.json` (cheap, <5ms)
and compare; if all match, we return immediately (no spawns, no IO
beyond the cache compare). Only after the user installs / upgrades IT
does the bundle version change → cache miss → per-CLI flow runs once,
then the state file is rewritten and the fast path resumes.

**Opt-in only.** Even on cache miss, CLIs that don't already have
`wt-agent-hooks` installed are skipped. The auto-upgrade never installs
into a CLI the user hasn't accepted. Disabled plugins are also skipped
(`enabled: false` in Copilot's `config.json` / `claude plugin list`).

**Per-CLI strategy.** Copilot and Claude use their `plugin update`
subcommands; before invoking them we rewrite any stale marketplace
`source.path` to the current bundle dir (Copilot: existing
`cleanup_stale_copilot_marketplace`; Claude: new
`cleanup_stale_claude_marketplace`). Gemini's `extensions update`
silently returns `NOT_UPDATABLE` when the recorded install source no
longer exists (typical after an MSIX version-dir bump), so we peek at
`~/.gemini/extensions/wt-agent-hooks/.gemini-extension-install.json`
first: if `type==local` AND `source` is still under the current bundle,
run `extensions update` in place; otherwise fall back to
uninstall+install while preserving the `isActive` flag.

**Trigger-point caveat.** The agent CLI master spawns concurrently may
already be past its plugin-load step by the time `plugin update` writes
the new files — so the freshly upgraded hooks may not take effect until
the next agent restart. Acceptable because blocking master startup on a
Node-based `plugin update` (1-30s) would hurt every IT-upgrade boot.

**Diag**: `wta-install-hooks.log` (existing) plus `target=agent_hooks`
+ `target={copilot,gemini}_hooks` trace events in
`wta-main_master.log` show every per-CLI decision (`upgrade decision`
log line carries `installed_version`, `bundle_version`, `action`).

## Logs & runtime data layout

WTA runtime data lives under the **package-private** store, split by lifetime
into two roots (both resolved in `runtime_paths.rs`, both falling back to the
same bare path when the process has no package identity):

```
# Packaged (every production wta process — helper is a conpty child of the
# packaged WindowsTerminal.exe, master is spawned in-package by SharedWta):

  …\Packages\<PackageFamilyName>\LocalState\IntelligentTerminal\   <- STATE root
      prompts\                      (prompt overrides)             intelligent_terminal_root()
      agent-pane-sessions.jsonl     (session origin index)
      master-pipe.txt               (helper↔master rendezvous)

  …\Packages\<PackageFamilyName>\LocalCache\Local\IntelligentTerminal\  <- LOCAL/cache root
      logs\<pkgver>\                (ALL logs for that build — Rust wta-*.log,
                                     C++ terminal-agent-pane.log, PS hook-trace.log)
      hook-bundle-staging\ …        (hook-installer staging)
      hooks-upgrade-state.json      (per-CLI bundle version cache for the
                                     hooks auto-upgrade fast-path)

# Unpackaged (dev builds run straight out of the Cargo target dir, tests):
# BOTH roots collapse to the legacy bare %LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal\.
```

Rationale for the split: **State** = persistent, must-survive, package-private
data → `LocalState` (alongside the WT app's own `settings.json` / `state.json`).
**Local/cache** = transient, regenerable diagnostics → `LocalCache\Local`, the
cache store that doesn't roam / back up.

Both roots are package-private — removed on uninstall and isolated between the
dev-sideload family (`IntelligentTerminal_rd9vj3e6a2mbr`) and the store family
(`Microsoft.IntelligentTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe`) — instead of sharing one bare
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal` directory. The family name comes from
`GetCurrentPackageFamilyName` (windows-sys); the `Packages\<pfn>\LocalState` and
`…\LocalCache\Local` paths are what WinRT `ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder`
/ `LocalCacheFolder` resolve to, so we construct them directly rather than
pulling in the WinRT projection.

**All three writers share one per-version dir** `logs\<pkgver>\`, where
`<pkgver>` is the **package version** (`GetCurrentPackageId`, e.g. `0.8.0.2`) —
read identically at runtime by Rust (`logging::package_version`) and C++
(`IntelligentTerminal::PackageVersionDir`), so no build-time version sync is
needed:
- Rust wta processes → `logging::log_dir()` (`logs\<pkgver>\wta-*.log`).
- C++ `AgentPaneLog.h` → `IntelligentTerminal::LogDirVersioned()` →
  `terminal-agent-pane.log` (renamed from the old `wta-agent-pane.log`).
- PowerShell hooks (`send-event.ps1`) → `hook-trace.log`, via the
  `WTA_HOOK_LOG_DIR` env var set to `LogDirVersioned()` (C++ ConptyConnection
  for shell panes; `spawn.rs` for agent-pane CLIs).

`IntelligentTerminal::LogDir()` stays the **root** (`…\logs`, no version) and is
used only by the bug-report-zip action so it archives every version at once.
Unpackaged (dev-from-cargo / tests) has no package identity → all writers fall
back to the flat bare `…\logs\`.

> Earlier builds wrote everything to the bare `%LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal`
> regardless of identity (the `LOCALAPPDATA` env var is **not** redirected into
> the sandbox on Win10/11). There is no migration — old data is left in place
> and simply ignored.

**Log level** is controlled by the `WTA_LOG` (or `RUST_LOG`) env var. When
unset, the default comes from the build: **debug builds default to `debug`,
release builds default to `info`** (`logging::default_filter_directive`). Set
`WTA_LOG=debug|trace` for the noisy traces, or `WTA_LOG=warn` to quiet a
release build further.

**Logging is initialized once** in `main()` immediately after arg parsing
(`logging::init(&process_label(&cli))`), before locale/ETW setup, so even
early-startup failures land on disk. The non-blocking appender's `WorkerGuard`
lives in a global and is flushed via `logging::shutdown_flush()` on every exit
path — including before each `std::process::exit` (which would otherwise skip
the guard drop and lose buffered records). Every launch mode — including
short-lived `wtcli`-style commands — now writes a log file (previously only 6
entry points did).

**Per-version storage + retention** (`logging::housekeeping`): each build's
logs live in their own subdir, `logs\<pkgver>\` (the package version — see
above). On every start, `prune_old_version_dirs` keeps **only the current
version's dir** and deletes all other version dirs wholesale. The current
version's dir is never a deletion target, so cleanup is **lock-free and
concurrency-safe** (no process can delete a file another is writing). Within the
current version's dir, per-PID helper logs older than **3 days** are pruned and
`wta-cli.log` rotates daily keeping 3 days (`max_log_files`).

### Log files in the helper+master architecture

```
wta-main_master.log        — wta-master process: agent CLI spawn, named pipe accept
                              loop, per-helper routing, session_to_helper map updates,
                              agent CLI exit detection, connection failures
wta-main_helper-{pid}.log  — each wta-helper process (one file per PID, so concurrent
                              per-tab helpers don't interleave): pipe connect, ACP
                              initialize, session/new, prompts, agent responses,
                              TUI lifecycle, connection failures
wta-cli.log                — short-lived wtcli-style commands (list-*, capture-pane,
                              listen, sessions, …); daily-rotated, 3-day retention
wta-delegate.log           — `?<prompt>` delegation flow (separate from agent pane)
wta-probe.log              — `probe-models` ACP model-list probe
wta-install-hooks.log      — `hooks install` agent-hook bridge installation
wta-ensure-host.log        — WT-side background ensure-running diagnostics (kept from
                              M3-M6 era; remains useful for SharedWta lifecycle)
wta-acp-debug.log          — low-level ACP JSON-RPC wire trace
```

Two files in the per-version dir are **not** written by the Rust wta binary —
`hook-trace.log` (PowerShell hooks) and `terminal-agent-pane.log` (C++ side);
see **All three writers share one per-version dir** above. They live in the
same `logs\<pkgver>\` and so are cleaned together with the Rust logs when that
version's dir ages out.

### Tracking flows by `target` field

All tracing uses structured `target` + key=value fields. Grep patterns for common
scenarios:

| Goal | Grep |
|---|---|
| Master process lifecycle | `target=master` (in `wta-main_master.log`) |
| Who's connected to master right now | `live_helpers=` in `wta-main_master.log` (climbs on connect, drops on disconnect) |
| Which helper owns a SessionId | `step="helper→agent" op="new_session" session_id=…` |
| Trace one prompt end-to-end | grep `session_id="X"`, look for `step="helper→agent" op="prompt"` (sent) then `step="master→helper" op="session_notification"` (response chunks) |
| Helper pipe lifecycle | `target=master helper_id=…` shows connect+exit |
| Agent CLI failures | `target=agent_stderr` |
| Connection failures (either side) | `"exiting with error"` — `target=master` in `wta-main_master.log`, `target=helper` in `wta-main_helper-{pid}.log`; plus inline `step="acp_initialize"` / `step="pipe_connect"` for the helper handshake |
| Internal control routing | `target=internal_control` (legacy; mostly empty post-Z) |

### Example: end-to-end trace of one user prompt

```
[helper] target=acp_client                — pipe connected to master
[helper] target=acp_client                — ACP initialize sent
[helper] target=acp_client                — session/new → session_id=abc-123
[master] step=helper→agent op=new_session — registered abc-123 → helper_id=2
[helper]                                  — user pressed Enter, sending prompt
[master] step=helper→agent op=prompt      — forwarding to agent CLI (sid=abc-123)
[master] step=agent→helper kind=agent_message_chunk — agent CLI streamed first chunk
[master] step=master→helper               — wrote chunk back to helper_id=2 pipe
[helper]                                  — chunk applied to TabSession.messages
[master] step=helper→agent op=prompt elapsed_ms=842 stop_reason=…  — turn ended
```

If any step is missing, the failure is at the previous step.

## Build

There are two independent build systems. **Both must be built** before F5.

### 1. WTA (Rust) — build first

```bash
# Kill stale WTA processes first
taskkill //f //im wta.exe 2>/dev/null; true

cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --manifest-path tools/wta/Cargo.toml
# Output: tools/wta/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/debug/wta.exe
#
# Always pass --target explicitly — the wapproj prefers
# tools/wta/target/<triple>/<profile>/wta.exe over the bare target/<profile>
# fallback, and a stale explicit-target binary will silently shadow your
# fresh bare-target build.
```

### 2. Terminal (C++ / MSBuild)

**Command line (incremental):**
```bash
cmd.exe //c "tools\razzle.cmd && bcz no_clean"
# Release: bcz rel no_clean
# Output: bin/x64/Debug/
```

**Visual Studio F5 (debug):**
- Set `CascadiaPackage` as startup project → F5
- MSBuild copies `wta.exe` from Cargo output into the package layout
  (via Content items in `CascadiaPackage.wapproj`)
- The deployed `wta.exe` sits next to `WindowsTerminal.exe` in the
  package directory, inheriting package identity for COM access

### Safe Debug deployment

After a Debug Terminal build, use this wrapper to deploy C++, XAML, IDL,
`wtcli`, manifest, resource, packaging, or mixed changes:

```powershell
.\build\scripts\Invoke-IntelligentTerminalDebugDeployment.ps1 `
    -AppxRecipePath src\cascadia\CascadiaPackage\bin\x64\Debug\CascadiaPackage.build.appxrecipe
```

The script validates the dev package and loose Debug layout, closes only exact
PIDs running from that layout, deploys it, and reopens Intelligent Terminal if
needed. It terminates IT panes and agent sessions but never ordinary Windows
Terminal. Never stop `WindowsTerminal.exe` by name; use `-WhatIf -Verbose` when
process selection is uncertain.

Do not use full deployment for `wta.exe`-only changes; use the WTA hot-refresh
flow. Static assets such as `wt-agent-hooks` are not `wta.exe`-only changes.

### Full rebuild flow (typical dev cycle)

```bash
# 1. Build WTA (always use --target — see note above)
taskkill //f //im wta.exe 2>/dev/null; true
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --manifest-path tools/wta/Cargo.toml

# 2. Build & run Terminal from VS
#    F5 in Visual Studio (CascadiaPackage project)
#    — or from command line:
cmd.exe //c "tools\razzle.cmd && bcz no_clean"
```

### Package identity & COM

The COM server (`TerminalProtocolComServer`) is registered under the
Terminal's package identity. `wtcli.exe` and `wta.exe` must also have
package identity to activate it via `CoCreateInstance`. This is why:

- `wta.exe` is deployed **inside the package** (next to `WindowsTerminal.exe`)
- `_DetectWtaPath()` prefers the co-located `wta.exe` over dev-build paths
- Running `wta.exe` from `tools/wta/target/debug/` directly will fail with
  `0x80073D54` (APPMODEL_ERROR_NO_PACKAGE) when calling COM methods

If autofix or the agent pane stops working after a debug launch, check
`%TEMP%\wta-ensure-host.log` for the `0x80073D54` error — it means
the wrong (unpackaged) `wta.exe` was used.

## Installer

See **[doc/building-installer.md](doc/building-installer.md)** for full details.

Two distribution formats:

| Format | Script | Output |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **MSIX ZIP** (packaged) | Manual assembly from MSBuild output | `artifacts/local-installer/*-msix.zip` |
| **Self-extracting EXE** (unpackaged) | `build/scripts/New-WtaLocalInstaller.ps1` | `artifacts/local-installer/*-setup.exe` |
