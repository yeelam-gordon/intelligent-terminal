rem Resolve MSBuild robustly instead of hard-coding one VS edition/drive:
rem   1. honor an externally supplied MSBUILD env var (CI / custom installs);
rem   2. otherwise locate it via vswhere, which works across Community /
rem      Professional / Enterprise / Build Tools and non-default install drives.
rem The value is stored UNQUOTED and quoted at each call site below.
rem Guard the vswhere call with `if exist`: on minimal/custom installs that
rem lack vswhere.exe, calling it would print a confusing error and leave
rem MSBUILD unset; skipping it lets the clear message below handle the case.

rem quotes (`""C:\...""`), which would spuriously fail.
