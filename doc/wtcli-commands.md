# wtcli Command Reference

`wtcli` is the CLI client for the Windows Terminal Protocol. It looks up the
running Terminal via the `WT_COM_CLSID` environment variable, calls
`CoCreateInstance(CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER)` to obtain `IProtocolServer`, and
exposes a tmux-style command surface over its IDL methods.

- Source: `src/tools/wtcli/main.cpp`
- IDL: `src/cascadia/TerminalProtocol/TerminalProtocol.idl`
- Primary in-tree caller: `tools/wta/src/shell/wt_channel/cli_channel.rs` (and
  `tools/wta/src/app.rs` for `publish`).

## Global flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON. Required for any caller that parses output. |

## Commands

The "Used in repo" column reflects whether some other component in this
repository actually shells out to that subcommand today (not whether the
subcommand is reachable). External callers (third-party agents, ad-hoc
scripts) are not counted.

### Persistent reconnectable sessions

`wtcli session ...` commands automatically adapt to the caller's execution context:

- **Auto-routing:** When executed within the same interactive desktop session as Intelligent Terminal (or when direct COM connection via `WT_COM_CLSID` or branded CLSID is available), session verbs (`create`, `list`, `inspect`, `attach`, `kill`) execute the direct COM/attach path locally and do **not** require running `wtcli session host`.
- **Session 0 / Non-interactive delegation:** When invoked from Session 0 or headless contexts (such as an SSH session without direct COM access), `wtcli` discovers and routes control requests through the resident `wtcli session host` relay in the target desktop session.
- **Guarded activation:** Ordinary session verbs never fall back to branded COM activation from Session 0 or other non-interactive contexts. They only use the branded CLSID when the caller itself is on an interactive desktop session; otherwise they require a relay host.
- **Byte path separation:** The relay handles control-plane commands and returns the attachment pipe metadata; `attach` streams bytes directly to the Terminal attachment pipe without routing raw I/O through the session host.
- **`wtcli session host`** is the resident per-user login helper. Run it in the interactive desktop session **after the user logs on** (or register it via Startup / Task Scheduler) for headless / Session 0 remote connectivity. It connects through `WT_COM_CLSID` when present, otherwise the build's branded Terminal protocol CLSID.
- Discovery is per-user and per desktop session. Auto-selection only succeeds when exactly one eligible host for the current user SID exists. If the same user has multiple interactive Windows sessions, pass `--desktop-session <id>`. Explicit `--desktop-session` selection is honored.
- Relay failures distinguish missing hosts, ambiguous hosts, stale endpoints, and access-denied cases on stderr; successful commands stay quiet unless the subcommand itself prints output.
- Availability starts only after interactive logon. Rebooting or exiting Intelligent Terminal ends the ability to reconnect. This MVP does **not** include a broker/service and does not support pre-logon or cross-user access.
- `attach` forwards raw VT bytes over a second local pipe while the GUI-backed
  tab/pane remains the owner of the ConPTY, shell, scrollback, and process
  lifetime. Detaching or an SSH disconnect closes only the attachment, not the
  pane. `kill` explicitly closes the pane.
- The attach path is best-effort through double ConPTY. Ordinary PowerShell /
  PSReadLine interaction, Unicode, cursor movement, and common TUIs should
  work, but the background GUI view may not exactly mirror a remote size change
  until the pane is shown locally again.

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `session host` | Run the resident per-user control host in the current interactive desktop session. | `wtcli session host` |
| `session create` | Create a background, persistent, reconnectable tab session in the current or explicitly selected desktop session. | `wtcli session create --name build -c "pwsh"` |
| `session list` | List persistent sessions from the current desktop session or from a selected relay host. | `wtcli session list --desktop-session 3` |
| `session inspect` | Show one persistent session's state, attach status, and metadata from the current or selected desktop session. | `wtcli session inspect build --desktop-session 3` |
| `session attach` | Bind the caller's stdin/stdout to a persistent session without taking over its lifetime; relayed control still returns a direct Terminal data pipe. | `wtcli session attach build --desktop-session 3` |
| `session kill` | Close the persistent session's backing pane explicitly in the current or selected desktop session. | `wtcli session kill build --desktop-session 3` |

| Command | Alias | What it does | Example | Used in repo |
|---------|-------|--------------|---------|--------------|
| `list-windows` | `lsw` | List all Terminal windows. | `wtcli --json list-windows` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`list_windows`) |
| `list-tabs` | `lst` | List tabs in a window. `-w` defaults to the first window. | `wtcli --json list-tabs -w 1` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`list_tabs`) |
| `list-panes` | `lsp` | List panes in a tab. `-t`/`-w` default to the first tab of the first window. | `wtcli --json list-panes -t 2` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`list_panes`) |
| `active-pane` | — | Return metadata for the currently focused pane. Used by other subcommands as the default `-t` target. | `wtcli --json active-pane` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`get_active_pane`) |
| `capture-pane` | `capturep` | Read pane scrollback as text. `-l` caps line count. `--last-prompt` returns only the most recent completed shell prompt (requires OSC 133 shell integration). | `wtcli --json capture-pane -t 3 --last-prompt` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`read_pane_output`) |
| `pane-status` | — | Report pane process state: `pid`, `state` (`running`/`exited`), and `exit_code` when applicable. | `wtcli --json pane-status -t 3` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`get_process_status`) |
| `new-tab` | `neww` | Create a new tab. `-c` command, `-n` title, `-d` cwd. | `wtcli --json new-tab -c "pwsh" -n "build" -d C:\src` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`create_tab`) |
| `split-pane` | `splitw` | Split a pane. `-d right\|left\|up\|down\|auto` (default `automatic`). `-H`/`-v` are legacy aliases for `down`/`right`. `-s` is size fraction; `-c` is the command to run. | `wtcli --json split-pane -t 3 -d right -s 0.4 -c "tail -f log"` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`split_pane`) |
| `kill-pane` | `killp` | Close a pane. | `wtcli kill-pane -t 4` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`close_pane`) |
| `focus-pane` | `focusp` | Move focus to the given pane. | `wtcli focus-pane -t 3` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (`focus_pane`) |
| `wait-for` | — | Block (poll `pane-status`) until the pane process exits. `--interval` is poll period in ms; `--timeout` is seconds (`0` = forever). | `wtcli wait-for -t 3 --timeout 60` | ❌ Not called. (`wta` exposes its own `wait-for` subcommand at `tools/wta/src/main.rs:209`, but its handler polls by shelling out to `wtcli pane-status` in a Rust loop — it does **not** invoke `wtcli wait-for`.) |
| `listen` | — | Long-running. Subscribe to `IProtocolServer` and stream every event JSON line to stdout until Ctrl-C. `-t` filters by pane id; `--event` filters by type and supports a trailing `*` wildcard. Internal callers use `--parent-pid` to terminate the listener if its owner crashes. | `wtcli --json listen --event "agent.*"` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` (background listener task) |
| `send-event` | `se` | Publish an event using the `agent_event` envelope: sets `type=event`, `method=agent_event`, fills `params.event` from `-e` and `params.pane_id` from `-p`. Omitting `-p` publishes an empty `pane_id` meaning "source pane unknown" — it is **not** attributed to the focused pane, because guessing a pane corrupts session-to-pane binding, while an unattributed event is routed by `cli_source` instead. Extra params come from the trailing JSON object. | `wtcli send-event -p 3 -e agent.task.completed '{"exit_code":0}'` | ❌ Not called from in-tree code. Kept as the transport for legacy PowerShell hook bundles (guarded by `Feature.LegacyHookBundle.Tests.ps1`) and as the public CLI surface for external agents in `doc/specs/llm-agent-event-integration.md`. |
| `publish` | — | Low-level escape hatch: forwards raw JSON straight to `IProtocolServer::SendEvent` with no envelope. Pass JSON as a positional argument for compatibility, or use `--stdin` for payloads that may exceed the Windows command-line limit. The two input forms are mutually exclusive. | `Get-Content event.json -Raw \| wtcli publish --stdin` | ✅ `tools/wta/src/wt_protocol_events.rs` |
| `info` | — | Print `WT_COM_CLSID`, connection status, protocol version, and the server's `GetCapabilities()` method list. | `wtcli --json info` | ✅ `cli_channel.rs` maps `get_capabilities` → `wtcli info` |
| `test-pipe` | — | Smoke test: connect, run `list-windows` + `get_capabilities`, print results. Diagnostic only. | `wtcli test-pipe` | ❌ Not called. Manual diagnostic. |
| `set-env` | `setenv` | Print shell-specific export statements for `WT_COM_CLSID` (`-s powershell\|bash\|cmd`). Output is meant to be `eval`'d / `Invoke-Expression`'d by the caller; it does not modify the current process. | `wtcli set-env -s powershell \| Invoke-Expression` | ❌ Not called. Manual recovery for child shells that didn't inherit `WT_COM_CLSID`. |

## Summary

- **Wired into `wta` runtime (13):** `list-windows`, `list-tabs`,
  `list-panes`, `active-pane`, `capture-pane`, `pane-status`,
  `new-tab`, `split-pane`, `kill-pane`, `focus-pane`,
  `listen`, `info`, `publish`.
- **Defined but not invoked from in-tree code (4):** `wait-for`,
  `send-event`, `test-pipe`, `set-env`. These remain as public surface for
  external agents / shell scripts and for manual debugging.
