# Hooks-Fallback Agent Session Watcher (Hybrid Tracking)

## Abstract

Intelligent Terminal (IT) surfaces a live list of agent-CLI sessions
(Copilot / Claude / Codex / Gemini) in the `/sessions` view. On `main`, the
data that powers that list — *which* sessions exist, *which* pane each one runs
in, and *what* each one is doing (Working / Idle / Attention) — comes from the
PowerShell `wt-agent-hooks` bridge that every supported CLI loads, plus the
*born-bound* registration for sessions IT launches itself (see
[wta-launched-cli-session-binding.md](./wta-launched-cli-session-binding.md)).

That coverage has a hole: a session the user **types themselves** (`codex`,
`copilot`, … in a normal shell pane) is only tracked **if the hooks plugin is
installed** for that CLI. If the user never opted in, or uninstalled the hooks,
the session is invisible.

This spec adds a **file/process watcher as a pure fallback** that fills exactly
that hole, for all four CLIs, **without changing anything about the hook path**.
The design principle is one sentence:

> **A real hook owns a session outright; #266 born-bound owns only its binding;
> the watcher fills the rest — surfacing user-typed sessions and supplying
> *status* for born-bound (delegate/resume) sessions that have no hook — and the
> three never double-track.**

The C++ side is unchanged — this is entirely a `wta` (Rust) addition: the
watcher itself, the two-set dedup (`hook_owned` / `born_bound`), an in-window
liveness gate, a liveness reaper, the born-bound *status* fallback, per-CLI
status detection (all four turn-based; Gemini is Working-only — it shows live
Working/Attention but defers the turn-end → Idle), and a codex
title-extraction fix.

## Background: Class A / Class B

IT classifies every session by `SessionOrigin` (`agent_sessions.rs`):

- **Class A — `AgentPane`**: an ACP session IT created for an agent pane. Bound
  via ACP `session/new`; activity comes from the ACP stream. Never depends on
  hooks. **Out of scope here** — the watcher never tracks Class A.
- **Class B — `Unknown`**: an agent CLI running in an ordinary shell pane. On
  `main`, Class B is tracked by:
  - **born-bound** when IT launched it (`?<prompt>` delegation, recommended
    opens, `/sessions` resume) — see the companion spec; or
  - **hooks** when the user typed it *and* the CLI has `wt-agent-hooks`.

The watcher targets the **remaining** Class-B sessions: **user-typed CLIs with
no hooks installed**. It is the last slice of the "de-hook" effort, shipped as
an opt-out-free fallback rather than a hook replacement.

## Goals

- When hooks are absent, still discover user-typed Class-B sessions, bind them
  to their pane, show live activity, and reap them when the process exits.
- Never produce a duplicate, a ghost, or a wrong-pane row when hooks **are**
  present — the watcher must be a no-op for any session a hook owns.
- Never surface a session that is not actually running in **this** IT window
  (the four CLIs write their session state to per-user roots shared by VS Code,
  language servers, other terminals, and other IT windows).

## Non-goals

- Replacing or modifying the hook path, the born-bound path, or any C++ code.
- Tracking Class-A agent panes (ACP already does).
- Perfect, instant fidelity. The watcher is a *fallback*; a few seconds of lag
  or a missed transient state is acceptable. We deliberately avoid adding
  polling sweeps or CLI-specific heroics to chase the last 1%.

## Principle: hooks own, born-bound binds, the watcher fills the gap

```
   real hook / ACP event   ──►  `hook_owned`  ──► watcher fully suppressed
   #266 born-bound              `born_bound`   ──► watcher supplies STATUS only
   (delegate / resume)     ──►                     (never re-binds)
   user-typed CLI, no hook ───────────────────► watcher creates + binds the row
                                  │
                                  ▼
                    wta-master registry (one row per session)
```

All paths feed the **same reducer** and the **same registry rows**. Two
master-side sets are the seam (see *Dedup*): `hook_owned` (a real hook / ACP
agent-pane event owns binding **and** activity → watcher dropped) and
`born_bound` (WTA-launched delegate/resume — binding only → the watcher may
still supply **status**). Everything runs always; there is no "hooks mode" vs
"watcher mode" switch and no install-state probing.

## Solution design

### The watcher (discovery + activity)

`session_watcher/*` is a [`notify`](https://crates.io/crates/notify)-based
recursive file watcher over the four CLIs' session-state roots:

| CLI     | Root watched                       | Session key |
|---------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| Copilot | `~/.copilot/session-state/`        | state-dir name (uuid) |
| Claude  | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`    | jsonl stem (uuid) |
| Codex   | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`     | rollout id (last 5 hyphen groups) |
| Gemini  | `~/.gemini/tmp/**/*.json`          | chat id |

It is **event-driven**: a single `for res in raw_rx` loop reacts to create /
modify events (`process_change`). There is **no periodic sweep** — an earlier
3-second hot-set sweep was removed once the watcher became a fallback, to keep
the cost proportionate. At startup, `seed_existing_progress_in` records the
files already on disk so a fresh master doesn't replay the user's entire history
as "new activity".

Each change is handed to the per-CLI classifier
(`classify_{copilot,codex,claude,gemini}.rs`), which decides whether the file
represents a real, top-level user session and what activity state it implies.
Codex subagent rollouts (`multi_agent_v1` / `spawn_agent` forks, identified by
`source.subagent` in the rollout `session_meta`) are **skipped** — they inherit
the parent's history and would otherwise appear as a duplicate row with the same
title.

### Binding & liveness (process-driven)

`proc_bind.rs` resolves the `(pane GUID, owner pid, cwd)` for a watched session,
best-effort, via Win32:

- `wt_session_for_pid` — reads the `WT_SESSION` environment variable straight
  out of a process's PEB; this **is** the pane GUID.
- `copilot_pid_from_lock` — copilot writes `inuse.<pid>.lock` in its session
  dir, giving an exact session→pid link.
- `file_owner_pid` — Restart-Manager (`RmStartSession` / `RmGetList`) reports
  which process holds a rollout file open (used for codex).
- `pid_alive`, `env_var_for_pid`, `cwd_for_pid` — supporting probes.

Binding confidence differs per CLI, and **this is the core reason hooks remain
preferred**:

- **Copilot**: lock-file → pid → `WT_SESSION` is exact.
- **Codex**: RM file-owner → pid → `WT_SESSION` is exact *while codex holds the
  rollout open*.
- **Claude / Gemini**: no lock file and no reliable open-file owner, so binding
  falls back to cwd correlation, which is ambiguous when two panes share a cwd.

A failed bind never blocks the row — it yields `pane = None` / `pid = None`. The
resolved `pid` is stored on the row as `bound_pid` (`session_registry.rs`) and
feeds the reaper.

### Dedup: how the watcher coordinates with hooks and born-bound

The master keeps **two disjoint** ownership sets (`master/mod.rs`):

- `hook_owned: Mutex<HashSet<SessionId>>` — sessions a **real** producer owns
  outright (PowerShell hooks, ACP agent-pane events). Owns binding **and**
  activity.
- `born_bound: Mutex<HashSet<SessionId>>` — #266 **born-bound** sessions
  (WTA-launched delegate `?<prompt>` and `/sessions` resume). These provide a
  pane binding but **no activity** — binding-only.

`handle_session_hook` routes each inbound event: a binding-only event (the
dedicated `intellterm.wta/session_born_bound` method, or a
`ResumeDispatched`/`ResumePaneAssigned` resume-binding event) → `born_bound`;
anything else (a real hook / ACP event) → `hook_owned` (and, if the session was
born-bound, drops it from `born_bound` — a real hook **takes over**).

`apply_watcher_event` then, in order:

1. `hook_owned.contains(sid)` → **drop** (the hook owns binding and activity);
2. `born_bound.contains(sid)` → **apply status only** (see below), never re-bind;
3. existing row `origin == AgentPane` → drop (Class A, ACP-driven);
4. otherwise → the normal create/bind/gate path (user-typed sessions).

There is no ordering requirement and the row identity is the same session id
throughout, so no duplicate is ever produced.

### Born-bound activity fallback

Born-bound (see [wta-launched-cli-session-binding.md](./wta-launched-cli-session-binding.md))
registers a WTA-launched session's `(session id → pane)` at launch and records
it in `born_bound`. It supplies the **binding** but emits **no activity**. With
hooks installed the CLI's hook supplies activity (and takes over); with **no**
hooks the row would otherwise sit at `Idle` forever.

Because born-bound hands us the **exact** session id, the watcher already knows
which transcript to read — the binding ambiguity that limits the *typed*
Claude/Gemini path doesn't apply. So for a `born_bound` session
`apply_watcher_event` applies the watcher's **status** event (Working / Idle /
Attention) to the existing row **without** re-binding the pane or touching the
origin — `emitted.event` is always a keyed status event (`ToolStarting` /
`ToolCompleted` / `Notification`), never a `SessionStarted`, so the binding is
safe. The liveness gate and `ensure_watched_session_row` are skipped (born-bound
already owns the live, vetted binding).

This covers all born-bound CLIs (**Copilot / Claude / Gemini**); Codex has no
`--session-id`, is never born-bound, and is naturally excluded.

**Resume.** `/sessions` resume publishes `ResumeDispatched` / `ResumePaneAssigned`
over the generic `session_hook` method (not the born-bound method). These are
the hook-free resume binding, so `handle_session_hook` records them in
`born_bound` rather than `hook_owned` — without this, a resumed session would be
treated as hook-owned and its row would sit at `Idle` forever even as the watcher
saw activity.

### Liveness gate: scoping to this IT window

The four CLIs write their session state to **per-user** roots, so the watcher
sees *every* such session on the machine — VS Code's copilot, the
copilot-language-server, agent CLIs in other terminals, and sessions in **other
IT windows**. Surfacing those would pollute this window's list (observed: two
"Idle" copilot rows appearing before the user opened anything).

The gate (`watcher_row_allowed` + `live_it_pane_guids`) admits a watcher session
only when its **bound pane is a live pane in *this* IT instance**:

- `live_it_pane_guids` walks `list_windows → list_tabs → list_panes` over the
  COM `IProtocolServer` channel, lowercases every pane `session_id`, and caches
  the set for 2 seconds. It returns `None` when there is no WT channel (tests,
  detached master), in which case the gate is permissive.
- `watcher_row_allowed(pane, Some(set))` = `pane` is `Some` **and** in `set`.

> **Implementation note (bug class to remember):** the COM JSON returns
> `window_id` / `tab_id` as **numbers** (`"window_id": 1`), so the walk must
> match `String | Number`. An earlier `as_str()`-only extraction skipped every
> window, produced an empty live set, and silently rejected **all** watcher
> sessions. The cross-shape match is load-bearing.

The gate runs **only** when a row is being created (`None`) or revived from a
terminal state (`Historical` / `Ended`); already-live rows skip it so a chatty
session doesn't re-walk COM on every keystroke.

### The 5-second reaper

Hooks emit an explicit close event; the watcher has no such signal, so a
dedicated `tokio::time::interval(5s)` task (`reap_dead_class_b_sessions`) ends
fallback rows whose process has gone. It transitions a row to `SessionStopped`
when **all** hold:

- `origin != AgentPane` (Class B only),
- `status ∈ {Working, Idle, Attention}` (not already terminal),
- `bound_pid.is_some()` — and `bound_pid` is set **only** by the watcher bind
  path, so the reaper effectively only ever reaps watcher-tracked rows, and
- `!pid_alive(bound_pid)`.

`pid_alive` is ~13 µs for a live pid; the per-tick cost is well under 0.1 ms for
realistic row counts, so the 5 s cadence is negligible. This is a net-new task
(master has no other interval; the `/sessions` view's 5 s re-poll is
helper-side and unrelated).

### Title resolution (and the codex AGENTS.md fix)

A watcher row is created with a **synthetic** title (cwd basename, or empty),
then upgraded from the CLI's on-disk artefacts by `try_refresh_title_from_disk`
→ `lookup_title_for_session`, the **same** disk-title path the hook and
born-bound rows use:

- Copilot → `workspace.yaml` `summary:` (fallback `name:`)
- Claude / Gemini → first real user message in the jsonl
- Codex → `codex_title_from_file` (first non-synthetic user turn)

Because the path is shared, a latent codex bug affected **all three origins**,
not just the watcher: codex auto-loads `AGENTS.md` when the cwd has one and
prepends it as a synthetic user-role record headed by codex's
`# AGENTS.md instructions` marker *before* the user's first prompt. The marker
has two forms (codex `UserInstructions::body`): `# AGENTS.md instructions for
<dir>` for a project `AGENTS.md` (`directory = Some`) and the bare
`# AGENTS.md instructions` for a global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
(`directory = None`). The old scanner skipped only `<environment_context>`, so
it titled the session with that doc heading instead of the prompt.

The fix is a shared `codex_user_text_is_synthetic` helper
(`history_loader.rs`) that recognises codex's injected blocks —
`<environment_context>`, `<user_instructions>`, `<subagent_notification>`,
`<turn_aborted>`, and the `# AGENTS.md instructions` heading in **both** its
`for <dir>` and bare forms (matched only as a whole heading line so a real
prompt that merely opens with the phrase isn't swallowed) — and is used by
**both** the title scan (`codex_title_from_file`) and the phantom-session check
(`codex_session_has_real_content`, so a never-prompted codex opened in an
`AGENTS.md` repo is correctly treated as empty rather than surfaced with a doc
title).

### Status detection (per-CLI)

The watcher maps each CLI's on-disk transcript to the same `AgentStatus` the
hook reducer uses, via three events: `ToolStarting` → **Working**,
`ToolCompleted` → **Idle**, `Notification` → **Attention**. A fresh/bound session
starts `Idle`; terminal states are `Historical` (startup history scan) and
`Ended` (pane/process gone); the 5 s reaper or a hook taking over moves a row out
of the live states.

- **Claude** (`classify_claude.rs`) — **turn-based, keyed on `stop_reason`**.
  Claude re-writes the same assistant message id several times as it streams
  (text first, then `+tool_use`), so classifying by content presence flickers;
  `stop_reason` is stable across the stream. A `type:user` record (typed prompt
  or `tool_result`) → Working; an assistant `stop_reason == "tool_use"` →
  Working, unless a `tool_use` names a user-input tool (`AskUserQuestion`) →
  Attention; any other `stop_reason` (`end_turn`, …) → Idle.
- **Copilot / Codex** (`classify_copilot.rs` / `classify_codex.rs`) —
  **turn-based**, not tool-based. One user prompt drives one or more agent
  *turns*; the agent is Working for the whole turn (thinking + streaming text +
  tool runs), so Working is bracketed by the turn boundary
  (`assistant.turn_start` → `assistant.turn_end` for Copilot,
  `event_msg/task_started` → `task_complete` for Codex), not by the brief
  tool-execution windows. Tool starts only refine the picture (current tool, or
  Attention for a user-input tool); the tool-completion record is ignored
  because Idle is owned by the turn end. An explicit permission/escalation
  record (`permission.requested` for Copilot, sandbox `require_escalated` for
  Codex) → Attention.
- **Gemini** (`classify_gemini.rs`) — **Working-only; turn-based Idle deferred.**
  Gemini's `session-*.jsonl` is an **append log** (re-verified 2026-06-14): every
  line is a standalone `{"id","type":"user"|"gemini",…}` record or a `$set` op,
  so the watcher reads it by byte offset like the other three CLIs. Each `gemini`
  message is appended **twice** under the same id (phase 1 text/thoughts, phase 2
  `+toolCalls`), interleaved with `$set:lastUpdated` bumps; a full
  `$set:{messages:[…]}` snapshot is written only at session **start** and
  **resume**. `classify_record` **skips every `$set` op** — crucially the resume
  snapshot, which would otherwise replay the entire prior conversation — and maps
  each activity record to **Working**: a `type:user` record (typed prompt *or* a
  `functionResponse` tool result), a `type:gemini` text record (phase 1 / final
  answer), or a `type:gemini` with `toolCalls` (tool name surfaced; a user-input
  `ask_user` → **Attention** instead). It **never emits Idle**: Gemini writes no
  turn-completion signal (no `stop_reason`/`finishReason`), and a `toolCall`
  carrying a `result` does **not** mean the turn ended — so a `gemini`-without-
  `toolCalls` line is ambiguous (intermediate text vs final answer). A Gemini row
  therefore stays **Working** through the conversation and only leaves the live
  state on `PaneClosed`; a clean turn-based Idle is **deferred** (needs a
  turn-end marker Gemini doesn't write, or hooks).

**Limitation — permission / ask-for-input prompts.**

- **Claude.** A tool that pauses for **permission** (e.g. `Bash`/`Edit` in
  `default` mode) is **indistinguishable** from a tool that is merely running —
  there is no approval/pending marker (only `permissionMode`). So a Claude
  permission wait shows as **Working**, not Attention; only an explicit
  user-input tool (`AskUserQuestion`) is Attention. (A `dangerous-tool →
  Attention` name heuristic was considered and rejected: it is wrong under
  auto-approve and conflates a running write-tool with a wait.)
- **Gemini.** The transcript is written **post-completion** — every on-disk
  `toolCall` is `status:"success"` with its `result` inlined, and an `ask_user`
  record already contains the user's answer. So the `ask_user` line lands only
  *after* the user replied; during the actual wait the file is silent and the
  last record (the agent's phase-1 text) shows **Working**. The `ask_user` →
  Attention mapping is kept (and is correct if a future Gemini build writes a
  pending state), but in today's transcript it is typically superseded by the
  immediately-following result record → the wait effectively shows Working,
  same class of limitation as Claude. Reliable wait-state Attention needs hooks.
- **Copilot / Codex** are **not** affected — they write explicit
  `permission.requested` / `require_escalated` records that map to Attention.

## What is explicitly unchanged

- The PowerShell hook path and the `intellterm.wta/session_hook` reducer
  semantics. (Born-bound now uses its own `…/session_born_bound` method so it can
  be treated as binding-only — see *Dedup* — but the wire body is identical.)
- All C++ (FRE "Install hooks", Settings UI, `ConptyConnection`,
  `agent_hooks_installer`, the four hook bundles).
- Class-A agent-pane tracking.
- The `/sessions` UI and its 5 s re-poll.

## Edge cases & failure modes

- **Hooks installed mid-session**: the first hook event marks the session
  `hook_owned`; the watcher row (if any) is adopted by the hook from then on,
  same session id, no duplicate.
- **Bind fails (Claude/Gemini shared cwd)**: row is created with `pane = None`;
  the liveness gate then withholds it (no live pane to match) rather than risk a
  wrong-window row. This is the conservative, accepted limitation that keeps
  hooks preferred for those two CLIs.
- **Codex holds, then releases, the rollout file**: binding is exact only while
  the file is held; if codex closes it the reaper still ends the row on process
  exit via `bound_pid`.
- **Other IT window**: that window's panes aren't in this master's
  `live_it_pane_guids`, so the gate withholds the row — each window shows only
  its own.
- **`notify` miss**: a dropped FS event means a late or missing appearance; the
  fallback nature makes this acceptable, and the startup seed bounds the blast
  radius after a restart.

## Capabilities

- **Security / Privacy**: reads only the user's own CLI session-state files and
  process metadata for the current user; no new network or cross-user access.
- **Reliability**: best-effort throughout; every probe failure degrades to "no
  row" rather than a wrong row. Dedup and the liveness gate are the two
  invariants that prevent duplicates/ghosts.
- **Performance**: event-driven (no sweep); the only timer is the 5 s reaper
  (sub-0.1 ms/tick). COM pane walks are cached 2 s and only run on
  create/revive.
- **Compatibility**: additive; with hooks installed, behaviour is identical to
  `main` (watcher events are all deduped).

## Testing

- Unit: `master::tests` (`watcher_event_*`, `watcher_row_allowed_*`,
  `live_it_pane_guids_*` — incl. numeric `window_id`/`tab_id` mock, `reap_*`,
  `session_hook_marks_*`; born-bound: `session_born_bound_marks_born_bound_not_hook_owned`,
  `born_bound_session_gets_watcher_activity_without_rebinding`,
  `real_hook_takes_over_born_bound_session`, `resume_binding_events_are_born_bound_not_hook_owned`),
  `history_loader::tests` (codex title / subagent / phantom), and
  `session_watcher` discovery/classify tests (incl. `classify_claude` turn-based:
  user→Working, `stop_reason` end_turn→Idle / tool_use→Working, streaming-partial
  stays Working, AskUserQuestion→Attention).
- Manual matrix:
  - hooks installed → row tracked by hook; master log shows watcher events
    deduped.
  - hooks uninstalled → user-typed codex tracked by the watcher with the correct
    real-prompt title (verified in an `AGENTS.md` repo); external/non-IT copilot
    sessions stay hidden; no PowerShell shell-hook events in the master log.
  - hooks uninstalled → a **delegate** (`?<prompt>`) and a **resumed** Claude
    session show live status (Working/Idle/Attention) from the watcher, not a
    frozen `Idle`.

## Diagnostics

`wta-main_master.log` (`target: "session_watcher"`):

- `refreshed live IT pane set panes={…}` — the COM-walked live pane set.
- `watcher liveness gate decision … resolved_pane=… gated=… live_pane_count=…
  allowed=…` — per-session admit/withhold.
- `upgraded synthetic title from on-disk session artefacts … title_len=…` —
  title resolution (a 69-char codex title was the AGENTS.md regression).

## Rejected / deferred alternatives

- **Hookless for all four CLIs (the original #258 approach)** — rejected:
  Claude/Gemini binding is too ambiguous and codex's RM binding is fragile, so
  hooks must stay authoritative. This spec is the salvaged *fallback* half of
  that work.
- **Polling sweep for perfect liveness** — rejected: disproportionate for a
  fallback; event-driven + the 5 s reaper is enough.
- **Pane-is-some filter instead of the in-window gate** — rejected: machine-wide
  CLI sessions also carry `WT_SESSION`, so only membership in *this* window's
  live pane set is sufficient.
- **Gemini turn-end → Idle** — **deferred** (see *Status detection*): Gemini's
  transcript has no turn-completion signal and a 2-phase / `$set`-interleaved
  shape, so the *end* of a turn can't be told from the log. Gemini already shows
  live **Working/Attention** (read per record from the append log); only the
  turn-end → Idle transition awaits hooks or a cleaner Gemini format.
- **`dangerous-tool → Attention` heuristic** — rejected: a permission wait is
  indistinguishable from a running tool in the transcript, and the heuristic is
  wrong under auto-approve.

## Future considerations

- A stronger Claude/Gemini bind (e.g. a CLI-provided pid file) would let the
  watcher cover those two as confidently as Copilot/Codex.
- A reliable Gemini turn signal (a `finishReason`, or a stable per-message
  completion marker) would let Gemini join the turn-based status model.
- If a CLI gains a first-class "session ended" file marker, the reaper could
  react to it instead of polling pid liveness.
