# WSL Agent Session Management (Historical MVP)

## Abstract

Intelligent Terminal (IT) surfaces a list of agent-CLI sessions (Copilot /
Claude / Codex / Gemini) in the `/sessions` view. Today every producer of that
list — the on-disk history scanner (`history_loader::load_all`) and the live
file/process watcher (`session_watcher`) — looks **only under the Windows user
profile** (`%USERPROFILE%\.copilot`, `.claude`, `.codex`, `.gemini`). A session
the user ran with the **Linux-native** CLI **inside a WSL distro** writes its
transcript to the distro's ext4 filesystem (`/home/<user>/.copilot/...`) and is
therefore completely invisible to IT.

This spec adds **historical** visibility and **resume** for those in-distro
sessions. It is deliberately an MVP:

> **List WSL sessions in `/sessions`, and resume a selected one back into its
> distro. No live status, no Attention/permission surfacing, no hooks inside
> WSL.**

The change is almost entirely a `wta` (Rust) addition. The C++ side is
unchanged except (later, deferred) a settings toggle; the MVP ships a `wta`-side
gate + environment kill-switch instead.

## Background: Class A / Class B, and what "WSL session" means here

IT classifies every session by `SessionOrigin` (`agent_sessions.rs:137`):

- **Class A — `AgentPane`**: an ACP session IT created for an agent pane. The
  agent CLI runs on the **Windows host** (spawned by `wta-master`); only its
  `cwd` may point into WSL (`\\wsl$\...`). `cwd_util.rs` already tolerates WSL
  UNC working directories. These are **not** the subject of this spec.

- **Class B — `Unknown`**: the user ran the CLI themselves in a normal shell
  pane. When that shell pane is a **WSL pane** and the user runs the distro's
  own Linux `copilot` / `claude` / `gemini` / `codex`, the transcript lands on
  **distro ext4** under the Linux `$HOME`. **This is the gap this spec fills.**

So "WSL session" throughout = a **Class B, in-distro** session whose on-disk
artefacts live inside a WSL distro, not on the Windows host.

## Scope

In scope (MVP):

1. Enumerate **running** WSL distros and scan each distro's Linux `$HOME` for
   the same four CLI layouts the host scanner already understands.
2. Merge the discovered rows into `/sessions`, tagged with their distro so the
   user can tell host rows from WSL rows.
3. **Resume** a selected WSL row back into that distro (new tab running
   `wsl -d <distro> -- <cli> --resume <key>`).

Explicitly **out of scope** (accepted MVP limitations, see "Known
limitations"):

- No live status for WSL rows (no Working / Idle / Attention; no watcher).
- No hooks installed inside WSL; no permission/Attention surfacing.
- **Stopped** distros are not scanned (we never auto-boot a VM).
- Only the distro's default-login `$HOME` is scanned (multi-Linux-user deferred).
- Shift+Enter "resume-in-agent-pane" (ACP `session/load`) is **not** offered for
  WSL rows (the helper/agent run on the host; loading a Linux session into a
  host agent pane is wrong). Shift+Enter == Enter for WSL rows.

## Read mechanism: Hybrid (in-distro fetch), running distros only

### Why not the UNC path (`\\wsl$\<distro>\...`)

WSL exposes distro ext4 to Windows over a **9P** file server bridged across the
WSL2 utility VM. Every `open`/`stat`/`readdir`/`read` is a round-trip across the
VM boundary (~9 ms each on the dev machine), and the existing scanner reads
**every** session's full transcript (for title + phantom classification) before
it sorts and caps to 50. That is hundreds–thousands of 9P round-trips per scan.

Measured on the dev machine (200 sessions / 400 small files, WSL2 Ubuntu):

| Approach | Cold | Warm |
|---|---|---|
| UNC read, all files, from Windows | 7.3 s | 3.6 s |
| In-distro read (one `wsl` spawn) | 3.6 s | ~1.1 s |
| First UNC touch of a **stopped** distro (auto-boots VM) | +5.7 s | — |

Two conclusions drive the design: **(a)** fetch bytes *inside* the distro
(local ext4) and stream them out in one spawn, rather than reading file-by-file
over 9P; **(b)** only ever touch **running** distros — the first access to a
stopped distro silently boots its VM and stalls for seconds (GH#9541).

### The hybrid: distro fetches bytes, host keeps all parsing logic

The existing per-CLI parsers (`load_copilot/claude/gemini/codex`,
title/phantom/mtime logic) are **unchanged**. We only change *where the bytes
come from*. Per running distro, a **single** `wsl -d <distro> -- bash` spawn runs
one pipeline that (1) ranks sessions cheaply by mtime and (2) streams exactly the
needed files out as a `tar`:

1. **Rank (cheap, no file reads):** `find` the four CLI roots under `$HOME`
   emitting `mtime \t path`, `sort -rn`, `head` to the per-CLI cap
   (`MAX_PER_CLI`, today 50). This selects the newest N sessions per CLI without
   reading any transcript. Each CLI is searched at its standard root
   (`$HOME/.copilot`, …); **Copilot only** is additionally searched at its
   snap-confined copy (`$HOME/snap/copilot-cli/common/.copilot`) —
   in WSL/Ubuntu a missing `copilot` prompts `sudo snap install copilot-cli`
   (the command-not-found handler), so snap is a common install path for it,
   whereas Claude/Codex/Gemini ship via npm and are searched only at their
   standard root. (`shopt -s nullglob` drops the Copilot snap globs cleanly on
   distros without them.)
2. **Bundle (one stream):** `tar -cf -` the files those top-N sessions need
   (Copilot: the session **directory** — `events.jsonl` + `workspace.yaml`;
   Claude/Gemini/Codex: the session **`.jsonl`**), relative to `$HOME`, to
   stdout. `tar` is a standard Linux tool; `-c` create, `-f -` write the archive
   to stdout (so the bytes flow back through the `wsl.exe` pipe), paths kept
   relative via `-C $HOME` so the extracted tree mirrors a real `$HOME`.
   `--transform='s|^snap/[^/]*/[^/]*/||'` strips the `snap/<app>/common/`
   prefix so snap-confined sessions land at a top-level `.copilot/...` in the
   archive — the host parsers (which only know `~/.copilot`) then read them
   unchanged. Requires GNU `tar` (the same GNU-tools assumption as `find
   -printf`).

On the Windows side, `wta` pipes that `tar` stream straight into the **Windows
system `tar.exe`** (`%SystemRoot%\System32\tar.exe` — libarchive-based, present
on Windows 10 1803+ and Windows 11; verified libarchive `tar` 3.8.4 on the dev machine),
extracting into a **temporary home directory** that mirrors the distro layout
(`<tmp>/.copilot/session-state/...`, `<tmp>/.claude/projects/...`, …). It then
calls the **existing** `load_copilot(<tmp>)` / `load_claude(<tmp>)` / … verbatim
and stamps `location = Wsl { distro }` on each returned row.

- **No new Rust dependency:** extraction uses the system `tar.exe`, so we avoid
  pulling in a `tar` crate (which would force a `cgmanifest.json` / `NOTICE.md`
  regeneration per `tools/wta/AGENTS.md`). If `tar.exe` is somehow absent, the
  distro is skipped with a logged warning (feature degrades, never crashes).
- **Zero parser changes:** because the parsers take a `home: &Path`, pointing
  them at the temp dir reuses *all* tested title/phantom/sort/cap logic.
- **mtime fidelity:** Gemini and Claude derive `last_activity` from **file
  mtime**, so the extraction MUST preserve mtimes. GNU `tar` records them and
  libarchive restores them on extract by default — verified end-to-end on the dev
  machine (extracted files kept their distro mtimes).
- **Fast:** the full round-trip (in-distro `find`/`sort`/`tar` → pipe → Windows
  `tar.exe -x` of 100 files) measured **~0.3 s warm** on the dev machine (vs.
  3.6 s warm for the file-by-file UNC approach).
- **Time-boxed:** the spawn is bounded by a timeout so a wedged distro/9P can
  never hang the scan; on timeout the distro contributes nothing (logged).

### Distro enumeration

A small `wsl` module exposes `running_distros() -> Vec<String>`, parsing
`wsl.exe -l --running -q`. Notes verified on the dev machine:

- Output is **UTF-16LE** with embedded NUL bytes and a trailing `*` marker on the
  default distro — must be decoded/trimmed (mirror the existing pattern used for
  `wsl -l` parsing elsewhere if any; otherwise decode UTF-16LE explicitly).
- No WSL installed → the enumeration spawn fails fast (no `wsl.exe`) → empty
  list. WSL installed but **nothing running** → one cheap `wsl -l --running -q`
  spawn returns empty → **no per-distro fetch spawns, no rows**. The only cost on
  a machine with no running distro is that single enumeration spawn (and it is
  itself behind the gate in "Gating", so a disabled feature pays nothing).

## Data model

Add a `location` dimension so a row carries *where* it lives:

```rust
// agent_sessions.rs
pub enum SessionLocation {
    Host,                      // default — Windows %USERPROFILE%
    Wsl { distro: String },    // in-distro ext4 under the distro's $HOME
}
```

- New field `AgentSession::location` (defaults to `Host`; every existing
  construction site is updated to set `Host` explicitly — `AgentSession` has no
  `Default` impl because of its `SystemTime` fields, so each literal must name
  the new field).
- **`SessionInfo::location` is the cross-process carrier.** The agent-pane
  `/sessions` view does **not** render from the helper's `AgentSession`
  registry — it renders and dispatches from a `snapshot: Vec<SessionInfo>` the
  helper fetches from `wta-master` via `sessions/list` (`SessionInfo` is the
  serde wire type; `session_info_to_agent_session` reconstructs rows for the
  view). So `location` must also live on `SessionInfo` (with `#[serde(default)]`
  → `Host` for back-compat) and be copied in both `agent_session_to_session_info`
  (master scan → registry) and `session_info_to_agent_session` (snapshot →
  view). Without this the distro stamp is silently flattened to `Host` at the
  master→helper boundary, killing both the distro tag and WSL resume in the real
  (snapshot-fed) view — the registry path is only a pre-snapshot fallback. This
  was the root-cause gap caught in final review.
- `discover::Discovered` likewise gains a `location` (defaults to `Host`, used
  only if/when the watcher is extended later; for the historical MVP only
  `load_all` stamps it).
- **The registry stays keyed by the raw session `key`; `location` is metadata.**
  `AgentSessionRegistry.sessions` is a `HashMap<AgentKey, AgentSession>`
  (`agent_sessions.rs:319`) and `merge_historical` already drops any loaded row
  whose `key` is already present ("live registry wins",
  `agent_sessions.rs:1134`). We deliberately **keep `key` = the raw CLI session
  id** (not a `wsl:<distro>:` namespaced string) because `dispatch_resume` passes
  `s.key` directly to `<cli> --resume <key>` — namespacing would force a strip
  step on every resume. A host/WSL key collision is astronomically unlikely
  (random UUIDs for Copilot/Claude/Codex; timestamped file-stems for Gemini; the
  two filesystems are disjoint CLI installs), and on the off chance one occurs
  the existing host-wins rule simply drops the WSL row — acceptable for MVP. The
  agent-pane-origin join matches on raw `key` too, and a WSL key is never in the
  host-only agent-pane index, so WSL rows correctly stay `origin = Unknown`.
  Composite `(location, key)` keying is a future hardening, not MVP work.

## Display (the "where did this come from" prefix)

The `/sessions` renderer already reserves a **row prefix slot** between the
selection caret and the title (`agents_view.rs:498 origin_prefix_for`, budgeted
through `prefix_w`). WSL rows reuse exactly this slot:

- `origin_prefix_for` returns a short distro tag for `Wsl` rows, e.g.
  `Ubuntu ` (distro name + space). Host rows are unchanged.
- The existing `prefix_w` width accounting already shrinks the title cap to fit
  the prefix, so no new layout math is needed.
- Tag **style** (plain `Ubuntu ` vs bracketed `[Ubuntu] `) — pick plain to match
  the existing un-bracketed agent-pane id prefix; final wording is a 1-line
  change.

This satisfies the "session title should say where it came from" requirement
without a second column.

## Resume (back into the distro)

Resume routing already exists: `decide_enter_action` (`session_mgmt.rs`) →
`dispatch_resume` (`app.rs:3040`). The only changes are in `dispatch_resume`:

1. **Build a WSL command line** when `s.location` is `Wsl { distro }`:

   ```
   cmd /c echo <banner> && wsl -d <distro> [--cd <linux-cwd>] -- <cli> <resume_flag> <key>
   ```

   - `<cli> <resume_flag> <key>` is the **same** trio the host path builds
     (`format!("{} {} {}", cli_id, profile.resume_flag, key)`); it just runs
     **inside** the distro, so it invokes the distro's Linux CLI that actually
     owns the conversation.
   - `wsl.exe` is on the Windows PATH, so the existing `cmd /c echo banner && …`
     wrapper (loading banner, issue #135) and the `wtcli new-tab -c …` launch are
     reused unchanged.
   - `--cd <linux-cwd>` sets the **Linux** working directory so the CLI's
     cwd-keyed session store resolves (Claude/Copilot key their store by cwd).
     Use the row's `cwd` when it is a Linux path (Claude path-decoded; Copilot
     `workspace.yaml cwd:`); omit `--cd` when absent and let WSL default to the
     distro `$HOME`. The Windows `-d <cwd>` arg to `wtcli new-tab` is **not**
     used for WSL rows (the Linux cwd is set via `--cd`, not the Windows starting
     directory).

2. **Skip the host-disk phantom guard for WSL rows.** `dispatch_resume` calls
   `history_loader::key_is_resumable_on_disk(&s.cli_source, &s.key)`, which
   probes the **host** `~/.copilot|.claude|...`. For a WSL key that path doesn't
   exist, so the guard would wrongly prune the row. For `Wsl` rows, bypass this
   guard and defer to the Linux CLI's own `--resume` validation (the same lenient
   stance already taken for unknown CLIs). A WSL-aware on-disk probe is a
   possible future hardening (it would need another in-distro spawn) — out of
   scope for MVP.

3. **Shift+Enter == Enter for WSL rows.** The `ResumeInAgentPane` branch
   (ACP `session/load`) is suppressed for `Wsl` location (helper/agent are
   host-side); both Enter and Shift+Enter route to the CLI-flag resume above.

## Gating: `wta`-side choke point + env opt-in (real setting deferred)

Following the repo's own MVP-gate convention
(`app.rs:62-78` — `MVP_SESSIONS_ORIGIN_FILTER` const + `WTA_SESSIONS_SHOW_AGENT_PANE`
env override), the WSL scan is gated at a **single choke point**:

- A function `wsl_sessions_enabled() -> bool` reads `WTA_WSL_SESSIONS`
  (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` enables) and otherwise returns the build default
  (**disabled** — WSL rows are hidden until the mixed host/WSL TUI is designed).
- The WSL seed (`spawn_wsl_seed`) only enumerates/scans distros when
  `wsl_sessions_enabled()` is true.

Rationale:

- **Gate at the scan, not the display.** Keeping WSL off means WSL rows never
  enter the registry → never rendered → and **no** `wsl.exe` spawn cost is paid.
  (Trade-off: enabling needs a re-scan to repopulate — acceptable for a toggle.)
- **Immediate control, zero C++/settings-model/XAML work.** Users who want the
  mixed host/WSL view early (or need to debug the scan) can set
  `WTA_WSL_SESSIONS=1` without a new build; if it misbehaves they simply unset it.
- **Future-proofed wiring.** When a real `wslSessions` setting is added later
  (`MTSMSettings.h` X-macro → `GlobalAppSettings` → C++ passes a `--wsl-sessions`
  flag to `wta`, same as `acpAgent`/`language`), it overrides the env default at
  the **same** choke point — a one-line change, no refactor. The settings UI
  toggle and the scan gate are the **same** boolean; no separate display filter
  is needed.

This is a deferred follow-up, not MVP work; the spec only commits to the
choke point + env override now. **The build default ships disabled** so the
session view stays host-only until the WSL TUI is designed.

## Where this plugs into the existing pipeline

`history_loader::load_all` is called from **both** the helper TUI process
(`app.rs:3741`, inside a `spawn_blocking`) and `wta-master`
(`master/mod.rs:1628`). The WSL branch lives **inside** `load_all`, so both
callers get WSL rows for free, and both already run the scan off the UI/critical
path. The per-distro spawn + timeout must stay on the blocking pool (never the
async reactor / UI thread).

## Testing

- **`wsl` module:** unit-test `running_distros()` parsing against captured
  UTF-16LE `wsl -l --running -q` bytes (default-marker `*`, NUL bytes, CRLF, empty).
- **Hybrid extraction:** unit-test the **selection + path-derivation** logic that
  turns a `find` listing into the per-CLI file set to bundle, and the **stamping**
  step that runs the existing parsers over a temp `home` and sets
  `location = Wsl{distro}` on every row. The `tar.exe` extraction itself is
  validated by feeding a pre-built tar fixture (no `wsl.exe` needed); assert
  parsers produce the same rows as a native host scan **and that mtimes are
  preserved** (drives Gemini/Claude `last_activity` + sort order).
- **`location` plumbing:** a row loaded from the WSL path carries
  `location = Wsl{distro}`; host rows carry `Host`. (Dedup is host-wins by raw
  `key` via the existing `merge_historical`; no new dedup test needed beyond the
  existing `merge_historical_inserts_only_new_keys`.)
- **Display:** `origin_prefix_for` emits the distro tag for `Wsl` rows and the
  title-cap budgeting still right-aligns the timestamp (extend existing
  `agents_view` render tests).
- **Resume:** `dispatch_resume` for a `Wsl` row produces the expected
  `wsl -d <distro> [--cd …] -- <cli> <resume_flag> <key>` argv (assert via the
  existing `DispatchedCommand` test seam), and the host-disk phantom guard is
  bypassed for WSL keys.
- **Gate:** `wsl_sessions_enabled()` honors `WTA_WSL_SESSIONS=0/1` and the build
  default (**disabled**) (guard env mutation with the existing serialization mutex
  pattern used by the `WTA_SESSIONS_SHOW_AGENT_PANE` tests).
- **No real `wsl.exe` in unit tests** — the spawn boundary is injected/mocked;
  `running_distros()` and the spawn helper take their raw bytes from a seam so
  CI (no WSL) stays deterministic.

## Known limitations (accepted for MVP)

1. **Running distros only, scanned once at startup.** Stopped distros are
   skipped to avoid the multi-second auto-boot stall. The scan runs only when
   `wta-master` starts, over the distros running at that instant, so a stopped
   distro's history appears only if it happens to be running at the *next*
   master start (≈ window restart) — starting it mid-session does **not** pull
   it in (see limitation #5). A future "start & scan" affordance could opt in
   explicitly.
2. **No live status / no hooks in WSL.** WSL rows are historical-only. Live
   tracking would need either an in-distro watcher (inotify) or a cross-boundary
   transport for hooks (a distro bash hook can't `CoCreateInstance` the host COM
   server) — both are substantial and deferred.
3. **Single Linux user.** Only the default-login `$HOME` is scanned; a distro with
   multiple Linux users surfaces only one.
4. **Resume phantom safety is the CLI's job for WSL.** The host-disk phantom guard
   is bypassed; a phantom WSL key dead-ends in the Linux CLI's own error rather
   than being pruned pre-launch.
5. **The WSL list is a one-time, startup-time snapshot — no liveness.** Because
   the scan runs only at master start (limitation #1) and there is no in-distro
   watcher (limitation #2), the following are simply **not reflected** for the
   life of the window. These are called out here, not solved, in the MVP:
   - **New in-distro sessions don't show.** A WSL session the user creates after
     master start — even inside an already-listed, still-running distro — is
     invisible until the next master start.
   - **No live status for WSL rows.** Working / Idle / Attention is never shown
     for WSL rows (restates limitation #2 from the liveness angle).
   - **Stopped → running transition is missed.** A distro that was stopped at
     master start (so skipped) and is started afterward is not picked up.
   - **Running → stopped transition leaves stale rows.** A distro that *was*
     running at scan time contributes rows; if it later stops, those rows stay
     in the list pointing at a distro that is no longer up — they are neither
     pruned nor marked stale (resume would simply re-boot the distro).

## Future follow-ups (not MVP)

- Real `wslSessions` setting + Settings UI toggle (wired to the existing
  choke point).
- WSL live status via an in-distro watcher.
- WSL-aware resumability probe (in-distro) to restore the phantom guard.
- Stopped-distro opt-in scan.
- **Liveness of the WSL list (call-out only — no design yet).** Make the list
  reflect changes during the window instead of being a one-time startup snapshot
  (see "Known limitations" #5). Deferred open questions, no mechanism chosen
  here: how to surface a **new** in-distro session and give WSL rows live
  **status** (Working / Idle / Attention) the way host rows get; how to pick up
  a distro that goes **stopped → running** after start; and what to do with rows
  whose distro goes **running → stopped** (prune, mark stale, or leave as-is).
- Multi-Linux-user enumeration.
- Composite `(location, key)` registry keying (only if a real host/WSL key
  collision is ever observed — see "Data model").
- **Scan WSL on master only.** `load_all` runs on both master and the helper;
  once `SessionInfo` carries `location`, the helper's open `/sessions` view is
  fed entirely by master's snapshot, so the helper's own per-process WSL scan
  (one `wsl -l` + a `wsl … | tar` round-trip per running distro, once per helper
  via the cached `ensure_history_loaded`) is redundant work. A follow-up can gate
  the WSL branch to the master caller (the host scan is already duplicated the
  same way, so this is a pure optimization, not a correctness fix).
