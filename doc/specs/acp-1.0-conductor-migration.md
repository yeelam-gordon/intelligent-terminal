# ACP 1.0 conductor migration — abstracting the master/helper plane onto the standard proxy/conductor model

## Abstract

WTA's agent plane is a hand-rolled ACP multiplexer: `wta-master` owns one
`ACP/stdio` connection to the agent CLI and fans per-helper sessions onto it
(`session_to_helper` routing), while each `wta-helper` is an ACP client over a
named pipe. All of this is built on the **0.10.x** `agent-client-protocol`
programming model (`impl acp::Agent/Client`, `ClientSideConnection` /
`AgentSideConnection`, `LocalSet` + `spawn_local` + `handle_io`, trait-style
`conn.method().await` calls).

`agent-client-protocol` reached its first **stable 1.0.0** release (2026-06-24),
so the 0.10 → 1.0 upgrade is now both unavoidable and worth doing deliberately.
1.0 changes two things that matter to us:

1. It **replaces the entire programming model** with a builder + dispatch model
   (`Client`/`Agent` are role markers, not traits; `cx.send_request(..).block_task().await`;
   `SessionBuilder`/`ActiveSession`; no `LocalSet`; the connection is `Send`).
2. It **ships proxy/conductor natively** — the [ACP proxy-chains
   direction](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/proxy-chains): `Proxy`/`Conductor`
   roles, `_proxy/initialize` / `_proxy/successor` wire methods, `start_session_proxy`,
   `on_proxy_session_start`, `send_proxied_message_to`, `ProxySessionMessages`, and
   MCP-over-ACP. This is no longer just the `sacp` prototype or an RFD.

This spec migrates the master/helper ACP plane to 1.0 and, in the same effort,
re-expresses master's bespoke fan-in/fan-out as a library-managed **conductor**
with composable **proxies**. Heading toward the ACP-proxy model is the real prize:

- **Modularity** — each cross-cutting concern (autofix, prompt/context injection,
  delegate/recommendation) becomes a self-contained proxy with a clear
  ACP-method boundary, instead of accreting in `app.rs`.
- **Free orchestration** — proxies are **reorderable, insertable, and removable by
  config**, not by editing the event loop; a new behavior is a new proxy in the
  chain.
- **Testability** — a proxy is a pure 1:1 transform with typed ACP in/out, so it
  is unit-testable in isolation, unlike the hand-rolled N:1 multiplexer it
  replaces.

It is a **feasibility assessment + phased plan**, not a final design.

## Inspiration

- The direction is the [ACP proxy-chains RFD — "Agent Extensions via ACP
  Proxies"](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/proxy-chains): extend an agent by
  chaining standard ACP proxies rather than forking the host. This migration only
  covers the master/helper **ACP** plane (the host↔agent pipe); the COM
  `IProtocolServer` surface is out of scope.
- `agent-client-protocol` reaching **1.0** (API declared stable) makes the
  0.10→1.0 jump unavoidable eventually, and 1.0 is exactly where proxy/conductor
  landed — so the upgrade and the abstraction win can be done together.
- Source of truth for the proxy API below: `agentclientprotocol/rust-sdk` at the
  1.0.0 release commit `12498fd22d75092e5709bd9d0e3a8a1a404e037b`
  (`src/agent-client-protocol/src/schema/proxy_protocol.rs`,
  `src/agent-client-protocol/src/session.rs`, `md/migration_v0.11.x.md`).

## Version timeline: 0.10.0 → 1.0.0

Our baseline is **0.10.0**. The significant changes up to **1.0.0** (source: the
crate's GitHub releases, `agentclientprotocol/rust-sdk`) — breaking changes
marked ⚠️, pivotal-for-us rows marked 🔑:

| Version | Date | Major changes |
|---|---|---|
| **0.10.0** | 2026-03-05 | ⚠️ Schema crate v0.11.0; more unstable feature flags. **(our current baseline)** |
| 0.10.1 | 2026-03-10 | Stabilized `session/list` + `session_info_update`. |
| 0.10.2 | 2026-03-11 | (unstable) `session/close`. |
| 0.10.3 | 2026-03-25 | (unstable) logout; schema 0.11.3. |
| 0.10.4 | 2026-03-31 | Schema 0.11.4; warning logs for silent RPC failures; clearer broken-connection error. |
| **0.11.0** 🔑 | 2026-04-20 | ⚠️ **"Migrate to new SDK design"** — the builder/dispatch rewrite (`Client`/`Agent` role markers, `connect_with` / `on_receive_*`, `SessionBuilder`, no `LocalSet`). **The break that forces our Phase 0**, and where the proxy/conductor primitives (`start_session_proxy`, `_proxy/*`) first ship. Guide: `migration_v0.11.x`. |
| 0.11.1 | 2026-04-21 | Drop `boxfnonce` dep. |
| **0.12.0** 🔑 | 2026-05-16 | ⚠️ **Extract MCP-over-ACP proxy**; stabilize `session/close` + `session/resume`; **remove direct `tokio` dep**. ⚠️ Removed `McpAcpTransport` (now advertised via `mcpCapabilities.acp`); renamed `McpConnectRequest.acp_url` → `acp_id`. |
| 0.12.1 | 2026-05-17 | Dependency bumps. |
| **0.13.0** | 2026-06-01 | Stabilize logout; **extract `rmcp` logic to `agent-client-protocol-rmcp`** (removes tokio/rmcp from core deps); (unstable, experimental) **protocol v2**. |
| 0.13.1 | 2026-06-01 | Schema 0.13.5. |
| **0.14.0** | 2026-06-05 | Stabilize `session/delete`, message ids, context usage; (unstable) **elicitation**; fix: serialize proxy metadata as `_meta`. |
| **0.15.0** 🔑 | 2026-06-19 | **HTTP/WebSocket transport**; (unstable) **request cancellation** (`forward_cancellation_from`); schema 0.14.0; replace `jsonrpcmsg` with shared schema types. |
| 0.15.1 | 2026-06-22 | Fix: **hide agent stdio windows on Windows** (relevant to our packaged helper). |
| **1.0.0** 🔑 | 2026-06-24 | API declared **stable**; schema 1.1.0; handle large future sizes in `run_until`. |

**Takeaways for this migration:**

- The unavoidable wall is **0.11.0** (full SDK redesign); 0.10.1–0.10.4 are
  additive/unstable and don't let us skip it.
- The proxy/conductor primitives we want arrived at **0.11.0** and matured
  (MCP-over-ACP extraction) at **0.12.0**.
- Dependency-graph wins land on the way: **tokio removed from core (0.12.0)** and
  **rmcp extracted (0.13.0)** → smaller transitive deps post-upgrade.
- `forward_cancellation_from` (our `session/new` timeout replacement) needs
  **≥ 0.15.0** (`unstable_cancel_request`).
- **0.15.1** carries a Windows stdio-window fix relevant to our packaged helper.

## Solution Design

### Today (0.10.x): two hand-rolled monoliths (app.rs reactor + N:1 multiplexer)

Two hand-rolled monoliths, nothing modularized. The helper's `app.rs` fuses every
cross-cutting concern into one reactor, and the master is a bespoke N:1
multiplexer — there is **no ACP-method boundary** anywhere, so nothing is a proxy.

- **fan-in** (helper → CLI): `HelperHandler` is a pass-through — it forwards
  helper requests verbatim to the shared `agent_conn` (`new_session`, `prompt`,
  …), adding only telemetry + a 120s `session/new` timeout.
- **fan-out** (CLI → helper): inbound `session_notification` and reverse
  requests (`request_permission`, `terminal/*`, `fs/*`) are routed back to the
  owning helper via `session_to_helper` / `MasterClient::route_for(session_id)`.

The 1.0 proxy/conductor model expresses per-session forwarding natively. The
canonical pattern (from `session.rs` docs) is:

```rust
Proxy.builder()
  .on_receive_request_from(Client, async |request: NewSessionRequest, responder, cx| {
      cx.build_session_from(request)            // intercept / transform session/new
          // .with_mcp_server(...)               // optionally inject tools (MCP-over-ACP)
          .on_proxy_session_start(responder, async |session_id| {
              // track/log only; forwarding is auto-installed
              Ok(())
          })
  }, on_receive_request!())
  .connect_to(transport)
  .await?;
```

Key primitives:

| API | Role |
|---|---|
| `on_proxy_session_start(responder, op)` | send `new_session` to the Agent, forward the response back to the Client, then install `ProxySessionMessages(session_id)` to auto-forward all later messages both ways (non-blocking) |
| `start_session_proxy(responder)` | blocking convenience = `start_session()` + respond + `proxy_remaining_messages()` |
| `ProxySessionMessages::new(session_id)` | dynamic handler that routes a session's messages — the **library equivalent of `session_to_helper`** |
| `send_proxied_message_to(Peer, dispatch)` | forward a raw dispatch to `Client`/`Agent` |
| `proxy_remaining_messages()` | drain queued messages, then hand off to the dynamic handler (race-free) |
| `_proxy/initialize` (`InitializeProxyRequest`), `_proxy/successor` (`SuccessorMessage`) | wire methods — **only needed when inserting additional proxies into a chain**; the basic helper↔master and master↔agent hops stay plain ACP |

### Fan-in / fan-out mapping (what the library subsumes)

| master today (hand-rolled) | 1.0 library equivalent | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| fan-out notif: `MasterClient::session_notification` → owner helper → channel | `ProxySessionMessages` auto-forwards agent session updates to the client | ✅ deletable |
| fan-out request: `route_for(sid)` → helper's `AgentSideConnection` | dynamic handler / `send_proxied_message_to(Client, ..)` | ✅ deletable |
| `forward_new_session_to_agent` + 120s timeout | `connection.send_request_to(Agent, req)` + `forward_cancellation_from` | ✅ replaceable (timeout/cancel via library cancellation) |
| `cached_init_resp` replay | builder role discovery + `InitializeProxyRequest` | 🟡 partial (see N:1 caveat) |
| `HelperHandler` pass-through → shared `agent_conn` | `cx.build_session_from(request)` → `on_proxy_session_start` | 🟡 partial |
| `session_to_helper: HashMap<SessionId, HelperRoute>` | library routes a single message by session_id; "which sessions belong to which helper, N helpers sharing 1 agent" still ours | 🟡 shrinks, doesn't vanish |

Estimated **~60–70% of the hand-rolled per-session routing can be deleted** and
delegated to the library.

### The topology caveat (the key honest finding)

ACP's proxy/conductor model is a **linear chain**: **1 Client → Conductor → 1
Agent**. One conductor builder `.connect_to(transport)` binds **one** transport
pair. WTA's master is **N helpers : 1 shared agent CLI** — a fan-in/fan-out
**multiplexer**, which the linear model does not express natively (M:N is
explicitly a *future* `peer` extension in the RFD).

- The library solves **in-session** forwarding cleanly.
- It does **not** give us, for free, "N independent client connections sharing
  one upstream agent connection." `ConnectionTo<Agent>` is cloneable and routing
  is by `session_id`, so one agent connection *can* host many sessions from many
  proxy front-ends — but **bridging N helper transports onto 1 shared agent
  connection remains our bespoke skeleton.**

**Net:** 1.0 solves the *per-session forwarding + insertable transform proxy*
half well; the *N:1 multiplexing* half stays ours.

**Why not the off-the-shelf conductor?** A ready-made conductor binary exists
(`agent-client-protocol-conductor`), but it solves a narrower problem: it
orchestrates a **linear chain for one editor ↔ one (spawned) agent over stdio**,
launching each proxy as a separate process. It has no concept of N clients
sharing one upstream agent ("Multiple parallel chains" is an unchecked Phase-4
item in its own design doc), and it runs as a standalone stdio binary — neither
fits WTA.

| | `agent-client-protocol-conductor` | WTA `master` |
|---|---|---|
| Clients | 1 editor (stdio) | N helpers (named-pipe server + accept loop) |
| Agent | spawns its own, 1 chain : 1 agent | **1 shared** agent CLI, reused by N helpers |
| Multiplexing | ✗ none (linear 1:1) | ✓ `session_to_helper` fans N onto 1 agent |
| Embedding | standalone stdio process | must live **inside the WT process** (COM package identity, `SharedWta` singleton, master-pipe rendezvous) |
| Maturity | MVP (crash-detection / tests still on its punch list) | production |

So `master` stays a **specialized conductor** (the N:1 multiplexer + WTA
lifecycle: agent-CLI spawn, pipe discovery, per-tab/window routing, alive-mirror,
restart) and **reuses the library's proxy/conductor *primitives*** —
`start_session_proxy`, `ProxySessionMessages`, `_proxy/successor` routing, and the
conductor's message-ordering guarantee (responses must not overtake
notifications) — *per session*. The library handles "how proxies are ordered
within one chain"; `master` handles "how N WT panes share one agent + WTA
lifecycle." The former is an inner part of the latter, not a replacement.

## Phased plan (de-risked)

- **Phase 0 — pure model migration (0.10 → 1.0), behavior unchanged.** Rewrite
  master + helper onto the builder/dispatch model. No proxy semantics yet. This
  is the largest, unavoidable step; isolate and verify it against the existing
  mock-ACP/render tests. (Checklist below.)
- **Phase 1 — master becomes a Conductor.** Replace the `session_to_helper`
  fan-out with `start_session_proxy` / `ProxySessionMessages`. Keep our N:1
  bridge skeleton.
- **Phase 2 — extract transform proxies.** Move the three strong transform cores
  out of `app.rs` — **autofix**, **context/prompt injection**, and
  **delegate/recommendation** — into standalone proxies wired via
  `_proxy/initialize` / `_proxy/successor`. This is where `_proxy/*` first becomes
  relevant, and it needs no further master change. See
  [Phase 2 detail: extracting the transform proxies](#phase-2-detail-extracting-the-transform-proxies).
- **Phase 3 (optional) — WT control via MCP-over-ACP.** Expose `wtcli` operations
  through `with_mcp_server` instead of shelling out. Larger rethink; separate
  spec.

### Phase 0 detail: the 0.10 → 1.0 model swap

Phase 0 is the behavior-preserving 0.10 → 1.0 model migration (no proxy semantics
yet). Below: the major SDK changes it absorbs, the file-by-file migration
checklist, and the structure that actually landed.

#### 0.10 → 1.0: the major changes (what Phase 0 absorbs)

Phase 0 is a behavior-preserving swap, but the surface area is large because 1.0
rewrote the SDK. The main blocks:

1. **Programming model: traits → builder/dispatch.** In 0.10 you `impl acp::Client`
   / `impl acp::Agent` — one typed `async fn` per ACP method, with the compiler
   guaranteeing you covered them all and the library owning the routing. 1.0 has no
   trait: you attach a single `on_receive_request` (plus one `on_receive_notification`)
   closure to `Client.builder()` / `Agent.builder()`, and it is handed the **whole
   `AgentRequest` / `ClientRequest` enum** together with a `responder`. *You* now write
   the `match` that routes each variant to a handler and replies via
   `responder.respond(..)` / `respond_with_error(..)` (results cross a
   `serde_json::Value` boundary instead of a statically-typed return), with a trailing
   `on_receive_request!()` macro wiring the dispatch table. Exhaustiveness is no longer
   the compiler's job — it is your `_ => method_not_found()` arm. That dynamic dispatch
   is precisely what Phase 1/2 need: a **proxy** can match the few messages it
   transforms and forward the rest verbatim, which a trait you must fully implement
   cannot express — so the rewrite is the enabling change, not gratuitous churn. WTA
   keeps the old typed ergonomics *behind* the `conn.rs` shim — `WtaClient` /
   `HelperHandler` / `MasterClient` keep their per-method fns (now invoked from the
   dispatch `match`) and `ClientLink` / `AgentLink` still expose `conn.method(req).await`
   for the ~10K call sites (outbound `.await` mechanics in #7).
2. **Connection objects removed.** `ClientSideConnection` / `AgentSideConnection`
   (object + separate `handle_io`) are gone; `connect_with(transport, main_fn)`
   hands you a `ConnectionTo<…>` plus the I/O future. We confine this to a compat
   shim (`protocol/acp/conn.rs`: `ClientLink` / `AgentLink` / `spawn_client` /
   `spawn_agent`) so the ~10K call sites keep `conn.method().await`.
3. **Connection is `Send`, but WTA keeps `LocalSet` deliberately.** 0.10's `!Send`
   connection *forced* a `LocalSet`; 1.0's `ConnectionTo<…>` **handle** is `Send`,
   so that hard constraint is gone. WTA still drives ACP I/O on a `LocalSet` +
   `spawn_local` (at `spawn_client` / `spawn_agent`) because the **dispatch handlers
   registered on the builder capture `!Send` state** — the helper's TUI / `App`
   state, `ShellManager`, `Rc` / channel handles — so `connect_with`'s driving future
   is `!Send` even though the connection handle isn't (`spawn_client` / `spawn_agent`
   take no `Send` bound). Making it fully `Send` (to run on the multi-thread runtime)
   would mean threading `Send` through the whole helper app for no real gain on a
   single-threaded TUI process — a possible *future* master-only change, not a Phase
   0 gap.
4. **Schema moved.** All message types moved to `acp::schema::v1::*` (~538 path
   moves); `ProtocolVersion` to `acp::schema::ProtocolVersion`.
5. **Proxy/conductor primitives shipped.** `Proxy` / `Conductor`, `_proxy/*`,
   `build_session_from`, `on_proxy_session_start`, `ProxySessionMessages` —
   unused in Phase 0, but the foundation Phase 1/2 build on.
6. **Dropped / changed APIs.** `session/set_model` + `SetSessionModelRequest`
   were removed (re-declared locally; the model list now comes from
   `config_options`); `unstable_session_list` / `unstable_session_model`
   stabilized; ext methods (`ext_method` / `ext_notification`) only
   enum-fall-through for `_`-prefixed names, so `intellterm.wta/*` became
   `_intellterm.wta/*`.
7. **Async / concurrency model.** Outbound calls can no longer be `.await`ed
   directly: `cx.send_request(req)` returns a handle resolved with
   `.block_task().await` (only safe in a spawned task) or
   `.on_receiving_result(cb)` (inside a handler) — awaiting it inline would
   deadlock the dispatch loop, and the type system enforces the distinction.
   Handlers run *inside* the dispatch loop and block further message processing
   until they return, so background work uses `cx.spawn(..)` /
   `cx.spawn_connection(..)` instead of `spawn_local`. The transport itself is now
   actor-split (separate read / parse / write tasks joined by channels),
   pipelining the large/bursty messages 0.10's single `select!` loop processed
   serially.

Concretely, the inbound half of the trait→builder shift (client side; the agent
side is the mirror image):

```rust
// 0.10 — implement the trait; the library routes each RPC to a typed method and
// the compiler makes you cover every one.
impl acp::Client for WtaClient {
    async fn request_permission(&self, a: RequestPermissionRequest)
        -> acp::Result<RequestPermissionResponse> { /* … */ }
    async fn create_terminal(&self, a: CreateTerminalRequest)
        -> acp::Result<CreateTerminalResponse> { /* … */ }
    // … one method per request + notification …
}

// 1.0 — register one dispatch closure on the builder; you match the whole enum
// and reply through `responder`. The `_` arm is now your responsibility.
let builder = acp::Client.builder()
    .on_receive_request(move |req: AgentRequest, responder, _cx| async move {
        use AgentRequest as Q; use ClientResponse as R;
        match req {
            Q::RequestPermissionRequest(a) =>
                respond_enum(responder, c.request_permission(a).await.map(R::RequestPermissionResponse)),
            Q::CreateTerminalRequest(a) =>
                respond_enum(responder, c.create_terminal(a).await.map(R::CreateTerminalResponse)),
            // … terminal_output / wait_for_terminal_exit / release / kill …
            _ => responder.respond_with_error(acp::Error::method_not_found()),
        }
    }, acp::on_receive_request!())
    .on_receive_notification(/* match AgentNotification { SessionNotification(n) => …, _ => {} } */,
                             acp::on_receive_notification!());

// outbound stays behind the conn.rs shim, so the ~10K call sites don't change:
//   0.10:  conn.new_session(req).await
//   1.0:   cx.send_request(req).block_task().await     // block_task/on_receiving_result: see #7
```

#### Phase 0 migration checklist (grounded in current code)

**Status: landed.** Phase 0 is done in this branch — `tools/wta/Cargo.toml` is on
`agent-client-protocol = "1.0"` (lockfile `1.0.0`), master + helper run on the
builder/dispatch model, and outbound calls resolve via
`cx.send_request(..).block_task().await` behind the `protocol/acp/conn.rs` shim (see
*Structure after Phase 0*). The items below are what landed; the single
plan-vs-reality delta is the `LocalSet`, **kept** rather than removed.

Blast radius by file (matches of the removed 0.10 symbols):
`master/mod.rs` 73, `mock_agent_tests.rs` 59, `client.rs` 29, `app.rs` 26,
`main.rs` 24, `probe.rs` 9, plus minor (`model_select.rs`, `cli_channel.rs`,
`wt_channel/mod.rs`, `session_registry.rs`).

**`tools/wta/src/master/mod.rs` (the conductor):**
- `impl acp::Client for MasterClient` → `Client`-peer handlers on the
      agent-side connection builder (or the proxy dynamic handler).
- `impl acp::Agent for HelperHandler` → `Proxy`/`Conductor` builder with
      `on_receive_request_from(Client, ..)` per helper.
- `ClientSideConnection::new(.. → agent CLI)` → a `ConnectionTo<Agent>` via the
      `conn.rs` shim (`ClientLink` / `spawn_client`).
- `AgentSideConnection::new(.. per helper)` → a `ConnectionTo<Client>` via the
      shim (`AgentLink` / `spawn_agent`).
- **`LocalSet` + `spawn_local` — *retained*, not removed** (the one plan
      change): the 1.0 connection is `Send`, but WTA still drives ACP I/O on a
      `LocalSet` at its entry points (`spawn_client`/`spawn_agent`). See *major
      changes* #3.
- **Async call model** — trait-style outbound calls
      (`agent_conn.new_session().await`, …) → `cx.send_request(..).block_task().await`,
      hidden inside the `conn.rs` shim so the ~10K call sites keep the
      `conn.method().await` shape. The full concurrency change
      (dispatch-loop-blocking handlers, `cx.spawn`, actor-split transport) is in
      *major changes* #7.
- Test doubles (`NoopClient`, `PendingNewSessionAgent`, harness) → builder model.

**`tools/wta/src/protocol/acp/client.rs` (the helper, WtaClient):**
- `struct WtaClient` + `impl acp::Client for WtaClient` →
      `Client.builder().on_receive_request(..)` callbacks (permission UI,
      `ShellManager`, terminal/fs).
- `ClientSideConnection::new(.. helper→master)` →
      `Client.builder()…connect_with(transport, main_fn)`.
- ~12 `dispatch_*` free fns taking `conn: &Arc<ClientSideConnection>` →
      `ConnectionTo<Agent>` via the shim (I/O still driven on `spawn_local`).

**Supporting:**
- `tools/wta/src/protocol/acp/mock_agent_tests.rs` — in-process mock harness
      moved to the builder model (`connect_for_dispatch` / `DispatchHarness`).
- `tools/wta/src/app.rs` — helper TUI loop off `handle_io` (`LocalSet` retained).
- `tools/wta/src/main.rs` — helper `run_acp_app` entry / `LocalSet` bootstrap.
- `tools/wta/src/protocol/acp/probe.rs` — `probe-models` ACP path.
- `tools/wta/src/protocol/acp/spawn.rs` — subprocess wiring on the 1.0 model.
- `agent-client-protocol = "0.10"` → `"1.0"` in `tools/wta/Cargo.toml`
      (lockfile `1.0.0`); message types moved to `acp::schema::v1::*`; third-party
      notices regenerated (`Generate-WtaThirdPartyNotices.ps1`).

#### Structure after Phase 0 (what actually landed)

Behavior-preserving model swap. The hand-rolled multiplexer **topology is
unchanged** from *Today* — same N helpers → N:1 fan-in/fan-out → 1 shared agent CLI;
only the connection primitives moved to 1.0, confined to one compat shim
(`protocol/acp/conn.rs`) so the ~10K call-site lines keep the old
`conn.method().await` shape. Because the shape is exactly the *Today* diagram with
each 0.10 node swapped for its 1.0 equivalent — `impl acp::Client/Agent` →
`Client/Agent.builder()` + dispatch closures; `ClientSideConnection` /
`AgentSideConnection` → `ConnectionTo<…>` via the `ClientLink` / `AgentLink` shim;
`HelperHandler` / `MasterClient` from trait impls to inherent-fn dispatch — it is
**not re-drawn here**. The node-level delta is the *0.10 → 1.0 major changes* list
above and the *fan-in / fan-out mapping* table.

> Key landed specifics: `impl Client/Agent` traits → builder
> `on_receive_request/notification` closures matching the **whole** `AgentRequest`/
> `ClientRequest` enum (responses serialize to `serde_json::Value`); `cx` is
> delivered async via a `Ready` cell (`spawn_client`/`spawn_agent`); the removed
> `session/set_model` is re-declared locally and model lists read from
> `config_options`; ext methods only enum-fall-through for `_`-prefixed names so
> `intellterm.wta/*` became `_intellterm.wta/*`. `session_to_helper` / `route_for`
> and the N:1 bridge are still hand-rolled — that is exactly what Phase 1 removes.

### Phase 1 detail: master → library Conductor

**Why a Conductor, and why master is the fit.** A *Conductor* is ACP 1.0's native
role for a component that sits between a Client and an Agent, intercepts
`session/new`, and then forwards every per-session message both ways. That is
*already* master's job — it just does it by hand (`session_to_helper` + `route_for` +
the manual notification / reverse-request fan-out). So adopting the conductor is
not a new layer but a **swap of master's bespoke routing core for a library-owned
one**: the library takes over per-session forwarding (with a message-ordering
guarantee — a response can't overtake a notification), which deletes the race-prone
cold-start-join / tombstone reconciliation that made the hand-rolled version
fragile.

Master is the fit because that routing core is intrinsically **per-session and
1:1** — each session has exactly one owning helper, which is precisely the
relationship the conductor models — and because master is the single point all
agent traffic funnels through (it owns the one shared agent connection and every
helper session), so it is also the natural home for the insertable transform proxies
Phase 2 adds. The parts that *don't* fit a stock conductor — the N:1 multiplexing (N
helpers sharing one agent CLI) and the WTA lifecycle (agent spawn, pipe discovery,
restart) — stay master's bespoke skeleton, so master becomes a **specialized**
conductor that reuses the library's per-session primitives rather than a plain one
(see the topology caveat).

**How it runs (per helper pipe).** Each helper still connects as a plain ACP `Client` over
its pipe; master answers as a `Conductor`. For every helper pipe master runs a
`Conductor.builder()` whose `on_receive_request_from(Client, NewSessionRequest)`
calls `cx.build_session_from(request)` then `on_proxy_session_start(responder, …)`.
That single call:
- forwards `session/new` to the shared agent `ConnectionTo<Agent>`, and
- installs a library **`ProxySessionMessages(session_id)`** dynamic handler that
  auto-forwards *both directions* for that session id — `session/update`,
  `request_permission`, `terminal/*`, `fs/*` — with no `session_to_helper` lookup.

**Deleted (hand-rolled routing retires):**
- `session_to_helper: HashMap<SessionId, HelperRoute>` and `route_for`.
- `MasterClient`'s manual reverse-request re-dispatch (`request_permission` /
  `terminal/*` / `fs/*` → owning helper).
- the per-helper `notif_tx` / `ext_tx` fan-out loops in `serve_helper` and the
  `agent_side_slot` (`Weak`/cell) plumbing that fed them.
- `HelperHandler`'s verbatim pass-through methods (the library forwards instead).

**Kept (still ours):**
- the **N:1 bridge**: the accept loop that takes N helper pipes + the single
  shared agent `ConnectionTo<Agent>` (one `AcpAgent`), because the conductor's
  native chain is 1:1.
- per-tab routing identity (`window_id` / `owner_tab_id`) carried in `_meta.wta`
  on `session/new` so WT-side reconciliation still addresses tabs.
- the `cached_init_resp` replay and the host `session/list` title sourcing.

**Wire & compat.** Helpers stay plain `Client`; the `_proxy/*` envelope methods
are used by the library *inside* the conductor, not on the helper↔master pipe — so
the named-pipe wire stays private plain ACP through Phase 1. Risk goes **down**:
the race-prone cold-start join / tombstone reconciliation around
`session_to_helper` is replaced by the library's per-session handler lifecycle.

### Phase 2 detail: extracting the transform proxies

`app.rs` is the central event-loop + state hub (`App` struct + the `AppEvent`
match), which is why every concern accreted there. Sizing (as of this spec):

- **16,137 lines total**; `mod tests` starts at L9787 → **~6.3K lines (~39%) are
  tests** (204 `#[test]`). Production logic ≈ **9.8K lines**.
- **422 fns** (~204 are tests → ~218 production); `struct App` ≈ **50 fields**;
  `impl App` split across 3 segments (L2244 / L8402 / L9347); `AppEvent` ≈ **50
  variants**.

A **proxy** here means a component that intercepts/transforms ACP traffic between
the helper (Client) and the agent CLI (Agent). Most of `app.rs` is **not** that —
it is TUI/state/connection/tab plumbing that stays in the helper.

| Responsibility cluster | Evidence (keyword hits / fns) | Proxy? | ACP seam & what extracts | Lifted from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth / connection / lifecycle | `auth\|login\|preflight\|setup` 529; ConnectionState; AgentConnected/Error/Busy/SoftStop | ❌ conductor/helper plumbing | — | — |
| TUI view / input / state | render, chip, scroll, help/debug overlay, Key/Resize/Focus, RevealTick (heavy render lives in `ui/`) | ❌ stays in helper UI | — | — |
| Multi-tab routing | `tab_session\|tab_changed\|renamed` 161; owner_tab_id/window_id; session_to_tab | ❌ helper's N-tab fan-out | — | — |
| **Autofix** | `classify_*` (10), `classify_wt_event`, `submit_autofix_prompt`, `fix_target_pane`, `AutofixTargetResolved`, WtEvent (303) | ✅ proxy | off-wire `WtEvent` → inject `session/prompt`: classify an actionable failure (OSC 133;D exit / connection state) and inject a fix prompt | `app/autofix.rs` |
| **Context / prompt injection** | `prompt\|persona\|planner` 355; PromptTemplateLoaded; `turn_submit_prompt`; `turn_close_finalize_planner` | ✅ proxy | `session/new` (build) + `session/prompt` (rewrite): prepend persona / template / context | `protocol/acp/prompt.rs` |
| **Delegate / recommendation** | `delegate\|recommend\|coordinator` 252; recommendation_tx; ChoiceExecution; DispatchedCommand; `turn_surface_recommendation` | ✅ proxy | `session/update` (response): parse a `RecommendationSet`, surface Run/Insert cards | `coordinator.rs` |
| Model pinning / override | `model` 282; `apply_global_acp_model`; `send_session_model`; SessionAttached re-apply; acp_model | 🟡 shim | `session/new` (request): rewrite the model field — folds into **context** | `apply_global_acp_model` |
| Permission policy | `permission` (11 fns, 113); PermissionState; auto-confirm settings | 🟡 shim | `request_permission` (agent→client): auto-decide per settings; card UI stays in helper — folds into the **conductor** | `ui/permission.rs` (policy slice) |
| Session registry / alive mirror | `agent_sessions\|alive\|session_to_tab` 270; AliveSnapshot/Added/Removed/JoinUpgrade | 🟡→✅ splits into the session-proxy family (list-union / enrichment / activity — see the criterion table below); only process-liveness + cross-window sync stay in the conductor | 3× `session/list` + `session/update` (see below) | `session_registry` / `agent_sessions` / `wsl_acp` |

**Verdict: 3 strong proxies out of `app.rs` (autofix / context / delegate); ~5–6
upper bound for the app.rs extraction.** The `Session registry / alive mirror` row
is *not* an app.rs core — it splits into the separate session-proxy family out of
the session subsystem (counted under *Proxy criterion & count* below). The last two
columns double as the **extraction manifest**: each proxy row is a pure 1:1 ACP
transform lifted out of a monolith — only the decision/transform core moves out; the
cards / pickers / TUI stay in the helper. (Proxy extraction is **Phase 2**; Phase 1
only turned master into the Conductor.)

#### Structure after Phase 2 (conductor + chained transform proxies)

The conductor from Phase 1 is unchanged; the three `app.rs` transform cores (autofix
/ context / delegate) become standalone proxies chained between the conductor and
the agent via `_proxy/initialize` / `_proxy/successor` — and the session-proxy family
+ the model / permission shims chain in the same way. The full chain below carries
the **same proxy set as the *Target* diagram** (this is just the LR chain view). Each
proxy is reorderable/insertable by config rather than by editing `app.rs`. The helper
TUI and the agent CLI are both untouched — they still speak plain ACP at the ends of
the chain.

### Proxy criterion & count (how many proxies, and why)

**Criterion.** A concern belongs in a proxy iff it can be expressed as *intercept
an ACP method, then transform the request or enrich the response* (the enrichment
typically rides in the `_meta` extension field). Anything that fails this test —
TUI rendering, the helper's event reactor / tab routing, connection/auth
lifecycle, and process-liveness / cross-window broadcast (multi-client state
sync) — is **not** a proxy.

By that test, eight concerns are proxy-able — and session management, far from
being one monolith, supplies **three** of them (it splits cleanly along its ACP
methods). But *proxy-able* ≠ *worth its own component*: the last two columns filter
each concern by whether it deserves a standalone proxy (the ❌ `session: residual
core` row is the counter-example — no ACP seam, so it stays in the conductor/helper):

| Concern | ACP method intercepted | Transform | Standalone viability | Likely outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| autofix | off-wire `WtEvent` → inject `session/prompt` | inject a fix prompt | existing `app/autofix.rs` (566) + tests; clear boundary | ✅ standalone |
| context / prompt injection | `session/prompt` (request) | prepend template / persona | existing `prompt.rs` (347); clear transform pipeline | ✅ standalone |
| delegate / recommendation | `session/update` (response) | parse `RecommendationSet`, surface cards | existing `coordinator.rs` (1861); clear boundary | ✅ standalone |
| session: list-union (discovery) | `session/list` (response) | union host + WSL history from the agent's `session/list` (already master-fetched), subtract Class-A index | host+WSL history **already** routes through `session/list`, so the seam exists | ✅ standalone (1 of 1–2) |
| session: enrichment | `session/list` (response `_meta`) | pass the title through (upgrading a synthetic live-row title in place) and stamp origin (Class-A/B) + liveness (Live/Ended/Historical) into `_meta` — the raw `session/list` has neither; live *activity* is **not** stamped here (it would be stale — that's the observer's job) | same `agent_sessions` / `session_registry` (~8K-line subsystem) | ✅ standalone (2 of 1–2) |
| session: activity (observer) | `session/update` (notification) | derive & own the live activity status (Working / Idle / Attention) for Class A (Class B activity comes from hooks / watcher, not this tap) | a 2nd live `session/update` tap (alongside delegate) | ✅ standalone |
| session: residual core | — (no ACP seam) | process-liveness probe + cross-window mirror sync (`intellterm.wta/session_added\|removed`) + local `PaneClosed` tombstones / cold-start join + Enter dispatch | multi-client state sync / UI dispatch | ❌ **not a proxy** — stays in conductor/helper |
| model pinning | `session/new` (request) | rewrite the model field | the whole job is "rewrite one field if an override is set" — a few lines, not a pipeline | 🔸 folds into context, or a conductor option |
| permission policy | `request_permission` (agent→client) | auto-decide per settings | the bulk is the card UI (`ui/permission.rs`), which stays in the helper; only the policy slice is proxy-able | 🔸 folds into the conductor/context |

**Net count: ~6 meaningful proxies** — autofix, context, delegate, plus the
**session family** (list-union, `_meta` enrichment, activity observer) — with
model + permission as optional thin shims **and a residual non-proxy session core**
(process-liveness + cross-window state sync) that stays in the conductor. The
number is a **granularity choice**, not a fixed value: consolidate aggressively →
as few as **3–4** (model into context, permission into the conductor, the session
list-union + enrichment as one, activity folded into the delegate `session/update`
tap); slice maximally → up to **8** (one per concern). **Don't over-slice the
session family:** the per-CLI `classify_{claude,codex,copilot,gemini}` strategies
each share one ACP method (`session/list` enrich / `session/update` activity), so
they are trait-object strategies *inside* those proxies, not four more proxies.
Boundary clarity matters, not the count.

**The session-status proxy *family* (the session-management collapse).** Session
management is **not** one monolithic proxy — it decomposes into **~2–3** along its
ACP methods: a `session/list` **discovery** stage (union host + WSL history from the
agent's own `session/list`, then subtract Class-A via the `agent_pane_origin`
index), a `session/list` **enrichment** stage (pass the **title** through — upgrading
synthetic live-row titles in place — and stamp **origin** + **liveness** into
`SessionInfo._meta`, which the raw `session/list` lacks; the live *activity* status
is deliberately **not** stamped into the snapshot), and a `session/update`
**activity observer** that derives & owns that live Working/Idle/Attention status.
The first two share the `session/list` response — one proxy in two stages, or two
chained proxies; the third is a separate `session/update` tap. This is a *natural* proxy seam because master
**already** intercepts here: `host_session_list_raw` calls `session/list` on the
running `agent_conn` to source history. Together they subsume the live-status
`session_watcher` and collapse much of the parallel registry + alive-mirror
reconciliation (`agent_sessions.rs` 3060 + `session_registry.rs` 2879). Two honest
caveats bound what *stays*:

1. **The list already unions history via ACP `session/list`.** The premise that
   master answers only from a Class-A registry is **outdated**: master seeds and
   reconciles its registry from the running agent's own `session/list` (host
   round-trip on `agent_conn` + per-distro WSL scan) and no longer disk-parses
   history, so host + WSL history rows are already present. The proxy's job is
   therefore to intercept the `session/list` response master already fetches (union
   WSL, subtract the Class-A `agent_pane_origin` index), **not** to scan disk. Bound:
   it is gated on `sessionCapabilities.list`, so a Gemini / non-ACP `custom:` agent
   returns empty history with no fallback.
2. **It is a snapshot, and liveness ≠ existence.** `session/list` + `_meta` gives
   point-in-time state (good for the `/sessions` picker); live focused-session
   activity is the **`session/update` activity-observer proxy** above. But "is the
   process alive right now" + the cross-window mirror sync
   (`intellterm.wta/session_added|removed`) + local tombstone / cold-start join are
   the **residual non-proxy core** — they fail the criterion (multi-client state
   sync), so they stay in the conductor. The subsystem shrinks (optimistically
   30–50%), it does not vanish.

**Suggested landing order:** (1) the 3 solid proxies (autofix / context /
delegate) — existing module backing, clear ACP-method boundaries, most test
migration; (2) the **session family** as a separate, larger workstream — slice it
into the `session/list` list-union + enrichment proxies and the `session/update`
activity observer, leaving the residual non-proxy core (liveness + cross-window
sync) in the conductor (the two caveats above); (3) model / permission as fold-in
decisions made only after (1).

### Phase 3 detail: WT control via MCP-over-ACP

Today the agent reaches Windows Terminal by **shelling out**: it spawns `wta` /
`wtcli`, which call WT's COM `IProtocolServer` (`CliChannel`). Every WT operation
(`list-panes`, `capture-pane`, `send-keys`, `split-pane`, …) is a fresh
subprocess. Phase 3 replaces that subprocess transport with **MCP-over-ACP**: the
conductor injects an MCP server into each `session/new` via
`SessionBuilder::with_mcp_server(...)`, exposing the WT operations as typed MCP
tools the agent calls **in-band** over the ACP connection.

**What changes:**
- `session/new` would carry a conductor-published MCP server through the
  ACP-native `with_mcp_server` path.
- Each `wtcli` verb becomes an MCP tool with a JSON schema; the agent discovers
  them via the MCP tool list instead of being told to shell out.
- No per-call process spawn; the agent issues a tool call and gets a typed result
  over the existing ACP pipe.

**Kept (the COM path stays the implementation):**
- WT's COM `IProtocolServer` + `TerminalProtocolComServer` are unchanged — they
  remain the *backend* each tool handler calls. Only the **agent→WT transport**
  changes (subprocess shell-out → in-band MCP tool call). `WT_COM_CLSID` discovery
  and package identity are untouched.
- `wta`/`wtcli` stay for humans and for agents that can only shell out; the MCP
  surface is additive.

**Caveats (why it is a separate, optional workstream):**
- **Security/trust.** MCP tools can mutate WT (split panes, send keystrokes) — the
  same authority `wtcli` has today, but now reachable in-band by the model. This
  needs an explicit trust/confirmation policy (it dovetails with the existing
  `aiIntegration.confirmation.*` settings) and is the security item flagged for
  "when proxies/tools are introduced."
- **Agent support.** The agent CLI must speak MCP-over-ACP. Copilot/Claude/Gemini
  expose MCP, but capability negotiation + per-agent quirks are real work.
- **Scope.** This is a larger rethink (tool schema design, error mapping,
  streaming `capture-pane`) and gets its own spec; it needs no further
  conductor/proxy change.

## Capabilities

### Accessibility

No user-facing UI change. The ratatui TUI, permission cards, and model picker
are unaffected; only the transport/dispatch plumbing under them changes.

### Security

Neutral-to-positive. The COM/`WT_COM_CLSID` trust boundary and package identity
are untouched. Phase 2 transform proxies can intercept/modify ACP traffic — a
trust consideration to document when they are introduced, not in Phase 0.

### Reliability

Phase 0 is the risk peak (large mechanical rewrite of two ACP planes + the mock
harness). Mitigated by: behavior-preserving scope, the existing mock-ACP and
render test suites, and landing it before any proxy semantics. Library-managed
forwarding (Phase 1) should *reduce* the surface for the race-prone hand-rolled
routing (cold-start joins, tombstones, etc.).

### Compatibility

- Agent CLIs (copilot `--acp`, claude/codex via npx adapters, gemini
  `--experimental-acp`) are **unaffected** — they receive a normal `initialize`;
  the proxy is transparent to them.
- 0.10→1.0 is a breaking API change for **our** code only. The helper↔master
  named-pipe wire stays private (plain ACP) through Phase 1.
- `agent-client-protocol` 1.0 was published the day before this spec; the proxy
  types note they are "intended to become part of the ACP spec" — treat the
  proxy wire format as still-settling for Phase 2 timing.

### Performance, Power, and Efficiency

Expected neutral. The new model removes `LocalSet`/`spawn_local` bookkeeping; the
extra proxy hop (Phase 2) adds small message-passing overhead dwarfed by LLM
latency (per the ACP RFD's own performance note).

### Modularity & testability

Estimates grounded in current code metrics (not measured outcomes).

**Modularity** — net positive, but bounded by what a proxy actually is (an ACP
transform on the helper↔agent wire), which is a *different axis* from `app.rs`
(the helper's UI/state reactor):

| Metric | Today | After |
|---|---|---|
| Reasoned units | 2 monoliths (`app.rs` 16K + hand-rolled `master`) | ~7–8 units (lean App + library conductor + autofix/context/delegate + the ~2–3 session proxies, ± marginal model/permission + a residual session core) |
| master per-session routing | hand-rolled `session_to_helper` fan-in/fan-out | library `ProxySessionMessages` → **~60–70% deletable** (3 of 6 mapping rows) |
| `app.rs` decoupling | 3 transform cores share App's ~50 fields + the `AppEvent` match | autofix / context / delegate move out as standalone proxies, own state |
| `app.rs` size | 16,137 lines | ≈ **−20–25%** (~3–4K transform-glue lines move out) → still ~12–13K |

Why `app.rs` does **not** collapse: rendering already lives in `ui/` (15 files),
and the autofix/coordinator/prompt cores already live in `app/autofix.rs` (566),
`coordinator.rs` (1861), `protocol/acp/prompt.rs` (347) — yet `app.rs` is still
16K. What remains is the **central event reactor**: ~50 `AppEvent` variants + the
dispatch match, per-tab `TabSession` wiring, the ~50 `App` fields, and ~6.3K test
lines. Proxies trim the transform glue; the reactor stays. Truly shrinking
`app.rs` needs *separate* refactors (split the event dispatcher, the
connection/auth state machine, the tab registry) outside this spec's scope.

**Testability** — concentrated, real gains:

- Of ~204 `app.rs` tests, **~55 (~27%) target extractable-proxy concerns**
  (autofix 21, permission 15, prompt 13, delegate 6, model 6) and can become
  **standalone proxy unit tests** — feed ACP messages in, assert transformed ACP
  out, with no TUI/App/`ShellManager` harness. Reuses the library's dispatch
  model + the existing `connect_for_dispatch` / `DispatchHarness` pattern.
- Exemplar: autofix's `classify_*` fns (`classify_osc133_*`, `classify_connection_*`)
  are already near-pure; extraction makes them genuinely unit-scoped.
- The other **~73%** are not "blocked from being unit tests" — they simply
  **aren't proxy tests by category**: render/UI tests (47) exercise `ui/` modules
  (presentation, not ACP transforms); session/alive/tab tests (51) exercise the
  helper/conductor's stateful multi-tab routing and alive-mirror (much of it
  belongs to the conductor/registry, which `agent_sessions.rs` /
  `session_registry.rs` already test). They stay as helper-UI / conductor-state
  tests.
- **Caveat:** Phase 0 first *worsens* testability — `mock_agent_tests.rs` (59
  hits) + `DispatchHarness` must be rewritten to the 1.0 builder model before any
  per-proxy gain lands.

## Potential Issues

- **N:1 topology mismatch (see caveat):** the bespoke multiplexer skeleton
  survives; do not assume the library erases it.
- **Mock harness churn:** `mock_agent_tests.rs` (59 matches) and
  `DispatchHarness` underpin most regression coverage — they must be migrated in
  lockstep or the safety net disappears mid-rewrite.
- **Phase 0 is all-or-nothing per crate:** the old and new connection models do
  not coexist cleanly in one binary, so Phase 0 cannot be landed file-by-file
  behind a flag without significant scaffolding.

## Future considerations

- Phase 2 turns autofix/context-injection into composable proxies — reorderable
  and insertable by config rather than code.
- MCP-over-ACP (`with_mcp_server`) could replace `wtcli` shell-outs for WT
  control (Phase 3).
- The COM `IProtocolServer` surface could later retire the hand-written
  session-management reconciliation — out of scope here, tracked separately.

## Resources

- ACP proxy chains RFD — "Agent Extensions via ACP Proxies":
  https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/proxy-chains
- `agent-client-protocol` 1.0.0 source (release commit `12498fd`):
  `schema/proxy_protocol.rs`, `session.rs`, `md/migration_v0.11.x.md`
  (`agentclientprotocol/rust-sdk`).
- `sacp` / `sacp-proxy` / `sacp-conductor` (Symposium prototype the upstream work
  came from): `symposium-dev/symposium-acp`.
- Existing internal design: `doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md`,
  `tools/wta/AGENTS.md`.

## Implementation status (Phase 0)

Branch `dev/<alias>/acp-1.0-phase0`. Build/test from the **worktree root** (not
`tools/wta/src` — that dir's `rust-toolchain.toml` pins an uninstalled channel):
`cargo build --manifest-path tools/wta/Cargo.toml`. Baseline = 1017 tests.

**Done — chunk 1 (committed):** Cargo bump 0.10→1.0; dropped stabilized features
`unstable_session_list`/`unstable_session_model`; ~538 schema-path moves
(`acp::<T>`/`agent_client_protocol::<T>` → `acp::schema::v1::<T>`). 311→**47**
errors, all structural. **No `agent-client-protocol-tokio`** (stuck at 0.11.1,
needs core ^0.11): use core `acp::AcpAgent`/`Stdio`/`ByteStreams`.

**Done — chunk 2/4 = chunks 2-4 bucket (build + 1017 tests green):** All 47 errors cleared. Connection
model confined to a compat shim `protocol/acp/conn.rs` (`ClientLink`/`AgentLink`
wrap `ConnectionTo`, `spawn_client`/`spawn_agent` return link + handle_io; cell
filled by `connect_with` so call sites keep `conn.method().await`). `impl
Client/Agent` (WtaClient/MasterClient/HelperHandler/MockAgent/PendingAgent) →
`on_receive_request/on_receive_notification` enum dispatch (`ClientRequest`/
`AgentRequest`, response enums serialize to `Value`). N:1 multiplexer stays
bespoke. **set_session_model** removed in schema 1.1 → re-declared locally; model
list is config-option only. **ext** (`ext_method`/`ext_notification`) only enum-
falls-through for `_`-prefixed methods in 1.0, so all `intellterm.wta/*` were
prefixed `_intellterm.wta/*`. `ProtocolVersion` → `acp::schema::ProtocolVersion`.

**TODO — beyond Phase 0:** clear residual dead-code warnings; revisit conductor
proxy abstraction (future-considerations) and MCP-over-ACP — these are Phase 1-3,
not part of this 0.10→1.0 bucket.
