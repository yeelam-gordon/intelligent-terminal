# WTA CLI terminal-action proposals

## Status

Implemented direct-only design. Terminal-action proposals travel from a
short-lived WTA CLI to the owning Helper.

## Summary

Autofix and Terminal Agent use a short-lived WTA CLI to submit typed action
proposals directly to the Helper that owns the current turn:

```text
Agent CLI
  -> wta propose-terminal-actions
  -> per-Helper named pipe
  -> existing recommendation card
  -> user confirmation
  -> existing wtcli/COM executor
```

The proposal command cannot mutate Windows Terminal. It can only ask the
owning Helper to display a recommendation card. The existing card confirmation
remains the sole mutation boundary.

ACP Assistant text is always chat content. It is rendered verbatim and is never
parsed into terminal actions or recommendation cards.

wta-master remains responsible for the shared agent process, ACP multiplexing,
session-to-Helper routing, and forwarding permission requests to the Helper
that owns the ACP session. It does not mint proposal tokens, receive proposal
payloads, correlate proposal results, or acknowledge cards.

## Goals

- Use WTA CLI, not MCP, for typed terminal-action proposals.
- Have the agent session execute one canonical command directly.
- Route the short-lived CLI directly to the owning Helper.
- Keep session, Helper, tab, window, and pane identifiers out of proposal JSON.
- Reject wrong-Helper, stale-turn, unapproved, modified, and replayed requests.
- Give the agent immediate validation feedback and final user-decision feedback.
- Preserve the existing Run, Insert, Open, Split, and Delegate card UI.
- Preserve exactly one visible user confirmation before terminal mutation.

## Non-goals

- Reintroducing MCP or adding another shared server.
- Using wta-master as a proposal router.
- Letting the proposal CLI execute terminal actions.
- Parsing terminal actions from ACP Assistant text.
- Treating arbitrary model-authored shell commands as trusted.
- Proving that arbitrary proposed shell input is non-destructive.
- Reporting whether a confirmed shell command eventually succeeded.
- Persisting proposal channels across Helper process restarts.

## End-to-end flow

```text
1. Helper starts a turn and creates one opaque channel.
2. Helper injects the channel and canonical invocation contract into the prompt.
3. Agent emits the exact canonical WTA command with inline proposal JSON.
4. Before executing it, the Agent CLI sends session/request_permission over ACP.
5. Master routes that request by trusted ACP session ownership to the Helper.
6. Helper parses the command before creating a Permission AppEvent.
7. For an exact current-channel invocation, Helper records the payload digest,
   moves the channel from Issued to Armed, and silently selects AllowOnce.
8. Agent runs the short-lived WTA CLI.
9. The CLI derives the per-Helper pipe from the opaque channel and connects
   directly to it.
10. Helper verifies channel state, lease, turn freshness, and payload digest,
    then atomically consumes the armed attempt.
11. Helper validates the typed proposal and stages the existing card.
12. CLI receives a validation response. If accepted, it remains connected.
13. User confirms or cancels the card, or lifecycle invalidation ends the turn.
14. CLI receives the final response and exits.
```

The permission request still crosses master because that is part of the ACP
topology. Proposal data and proposal state do not.

## Channel and endpoint

Each Helper process creates a random instance identifier and one stable named
pipe:

```text
channel: v1.<helper-instance-id>.<turn-nonce>
pipe:    \\.\pipe\IntelligentTerminal.Proposal.<helper-instance-id>
```

Both identifiers use lower-case UUID simple form: 32 hexadecimal characters
without braces or separators. The agent copies the complete channel as an
opaque string. It never constructs or receives separate Helper, session, tab,
window, pane, or prompt identifiers.

The Helper instance and pipe survive pane stash/restore and `/new`. A Helper
process restart creates a new instance and pipe, permanently invalidating all
old channels.

Only one channel is active per Helper. Starting a newer turn invalidates the
previous channel before the new one is issued.

## Canonical invocation

The only auto-approvable PowerShell form is:

```powershell
& "$env:WTA_CLI_PATH" propose-terminal-actions --channel <channel> --payload-json '<compact-json>'
```

For a packaged installation, WTA sets `WTA_CLI_PATH` to the package-family
specific App Execution Alias at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\<package-family>\wta.exe`. This lets an
external Agent launch WTA through the registered package boundary instead of
directly executing the protected package file. An unpackaged development build
uses its trusted current executable path instead. Proposal JSON must be compact
UTF-8 JSON encoded as one PowerShell single-quoted argument; literal
apostrophes are escaped by doubling them. The command has no pipeline,
redirection, here-string, command substitution, temporary file, extra
argument, or alternate executable spelling.

The Helper uses one renderer/parser implementation for prompt generation and
permission matching. It does not infer safety from the agent-authored tool
title.

The permission request must describe one execute operation with a `command`
field and a single-entry `commands` array containing the same canonical command.
Agent adapters that emit another permission envelope fail arming and therefore
surface their integration gap instead of falling back to Assistant text.

Permission policy has three outcomes:

| Input | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Exact canonical command for the current channel and compact JSON payload, with successful arming | Silently `AllowOnce` |
| Recognizable proposal command with unsafe or non-canonical syntax | Silently cancel |
| Any unrelated command | Use the existing Permission UI |

Returning `AllowOnce` and transitioning the channel to `Armed` are one
indivisible permission outcome. If arming fails for any reason, including a
different or stale channel, the Helper silently cancels the permission request
and the Agent must not launch the CLI.
`AllowAlways` is never selected because every proposal must pass through
per-turn arming.

## CLI contract

```text
wta propose-terminal-actions --channel <channel> --payload-json <compact-json>
```

The command does not accept stdin, `--payload-file`, a master pipe, a Helper
pipe, or separate routing identifiers. Inline payload size is limited to
8 KiB UTF-8 before deserialization.

The CLI parses the channel, derives the pipe name, sends one request frame, and
reads newline-delimited compact JSON responses. stdout is protocol-only.
Diagnostics go to stderr.

Protocol-complete rejections exit successfully so the agent can interpret the
response and decide whether to retry. CLI syntax, malformed channel, broken
transport, and internal failures use a nonzero exit status.

## Pipe protocol

Protocol version 1 uses UTF-8 JSON Lines with a maximum encoded line size of
49 KiB, covering worst-case JSON escaping for the 8 KiB payload plus protocol
overhead. One connection carries exactly one request and its responses.

Request:

```json
{"version":1,"channel":"v1.<helper>.<turn>","payload":"{...}"}
```

Immediate validation success:

```json
{"phase":"validation","status":"accepted","proposal_id":"<uuid>","retryable":false}
```

Immediate validation failure:

```json
{"phase":"validation","status":"invalid_schema","reason":"...","retryable":true}
```

Final response after an accepted validation:

```json
{"phase":"final","status":"confirmed","proposal_id":"<uuid>"}
```

Validation statuses:

- `accepted`
- `unknown_channel`
- `helper_mismatch`
- `not_armed`
- `stale`
- `superseded`
- `expired`
- `digest_mismatch`
- `already_consumed`
- `invalid_schema`
- `rejected`
- `unavailable`

Final statuses:

- `confirmed`
- `cancelled`
- `superseded`
- `session_replaced`
- `timed_out`
- `unavailable`

`confirmed` means the selected card action was dispatched to the existing
executor. It does not claim that a target shell command finished successfully.

## Helper channel state

```text
Issued
  -> Armed
  -> Validating
  -> AwaitingUser
  -> Confirmed | Cancelled | Superseded | SessionReplaced
                  | TimedOut | Unavailable
```

The Helper stores:

```text
ProposalChannelManager
  helper_instance_id
  session_epoch
  active_channel
  bounded_tombstones
```

An active channel contains its nonce, session epoch, Helper-local prompt
identity, state, retry count, optional digest, lease deadline, and optional
pending final responder. It does not contain model-authored target identity.

Before accepting a pipe request, the Helper checks in order:

1. protocol version and frame limits;
2. Helper instance encoded in the channel;
3. active channel or bounded tombstone;
4. channel state is `Armed`;
5. 30-second armed lease has not expired;
6. session epoch and prompt identity are still current;
7. SHA-256 of the exact payload bytes matches the armed digest;
8. atomic one-use transition to `Validating`;
9. strict proposal schema and origin policy;
10. trusted active target injection by App.

After schema rejection, the channel returns to `Issued` and clears its digest.
The agent may correct the payload, request permission again, and retry up to
two times. An accepted proposal is one-use. Lifecycle and user-decision
terminal states are not retryable.

## Proposal schema and trusted target

The public payload is the versioned schema defined by
`tools/wta/src/agent_tools/action_proposal/schema.rs`. It uses
`deny_unknown_fields`, explicit count and size limits, and hand-written
conversion to `RecommendationSet`.

It never accepts:

- ACP session or Helper identifiers;
- window, tab, pane, prompt, or pipe identifiers;
- model-authored parent pane identifiers;
- arbitrary agent executable paths.

Terminal Agent proposals contain one to three choices. App binds `send` and
panel actions to the trusted pane captured for that turn and resolves delegate
actions only through configured policy.

Autofix accepts exactly one choice with one `send` action. App binds it to the
recorded failing pane and matching Autofix generation.

## Lifecycle

The ownership hierarchy is:

```text
Helper process
  -> ACP session epoch
     -> active turn channel
```

Lifecycle transitions invalidate the channel before replacing the owning
session or process:

| Event | Result |
|---|---|
| New prompt in same session | Previous channel becomes `superseded`; issue a new channel |
| `/stop` | In-flight channel becomes `cancelled` |
| `/new` or load another session | Increment epoch; old channel becomes `session_replaced`; pipe remains |
| `/restart` | Helper and pipe are destroyed; waiting clients become unavailable |
| Pane stash/restore | Preserve Helper, pipe, session, channel, and card |
| Card confirm | Atomically claim the live proposal, dispatch through the existing executor, then send `confirmed` |
| Card cancel/dismiss | Send `cancelled` |
| User-decision timeout | Send `timed_out` after 10 minutes |
| ACP transport lost | Send `unavailable` and refuse new channels |
| Tab/window close or Ctrl+C twice | Destroy Helper and pipe |

The Helper retains at most four terminal tombstones for three minutes.
Tombstones contain only a channel hash, terminal status, and timestamp. They
improve errors for late clients without retaining payload, digest, or target
data. They are not persisted.

## Security model

The channel is an unguessable, short-lived bearer handle. The per-user named
pipe ACL, Helper-instance routing, per-turn nonce, ACP-session permission
routing, payload digest, short armed lease, and one-use transition prevent
normal cross-tab mistakes, stale turns, payload changes, and replay.

The Helper-side permission decision is essential: knowing an issued channel is
not enough to submit a proposal; the exact payload must first be armed through
the owning ACP session.

A malicious process that can read the complete armed channel and exact payload
from the agent process and race that process can still use the bearer handle.
The direct-pipe design does not claim process attestation. This residual risk
is bounded because the CLI only proposes a visible card and user confirmation
is still required before mutation.

## Validation

Direct Helper routing is the only card-producing path for every configured ACP
agent. Integrations must prove canonical command execution, permission routing,
and Windows/WSL reachability directly; Assistant text cannot mask a broken
proposal path.

Automated and live coverage must include:

- channel parsing, uniqueness, one-use, lease, retries, tombstones, and epochs;
- canonical rendering/parsing, quoting, extra-token rejection, and auto-policy;
- pipe framing, size limits, disconnects, and two-phase responses;
- wrong Helper, wrong turn, stale, unarmed, digest mismatch, and replay;
- schema and origin policy validation with trusted target injection;
- card confirm, cancel, supersede, timeout, and Helper shutdown;
- `/stop`, `/new`, session load, `/restart`, stash/restore, tab/window close;
- multi-tab and multi-window isolation;
- no Permission UI for an exact canonical proposal;
- Assistant JSON remains visible chat text and never surfaces a card;
- no terminal mutation before card confirmation;
- explicit Windows-target WTA build and packaged live verification.
