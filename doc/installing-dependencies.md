# Installing dependencies for Intelligent Terminal

Intelligent Terminal's **first-run experience (FRE)** is designed to install
the blocking prerequisites it owns for you automatically — Node.js when it is
needed, shell integration for the shells it supports (PowerShell, bash, and
WSL bash), and agent session hooks. GitHub Copilot CLI setup is deferred to
the agent pane so a missing or failed Copilot installation cannot prevent you
from reaching the terminal.

This document exists for the circumstances where the FRE cannot do the job
on its own, including:

- You are switching to (or adding) **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**,
  **Gemini**, **OpenCode**, or **Antigravity** — agent CLIs the FRE does **not** install for you.
- An FRE step failed — for example, `winget` is missing or blocked, your
  PowerShell execution policy is locked down by Group Policy, or the
  Node.js install did not pick up on `PATH` — and you need to finish the
  installation by hand.
- You followed a **deep link to a specific step** from the FRE's manual-
  resolution guidance or from a GitHub issue. Each dependency has its own
  section with a stable anchor so it can be linked to directly.

## 1. WinGet (Windows Package Manager)

**Why you need it:** Intelligent Terminal can use `winget` to install
Node.js during the first-run experience and GitHub Copilot CLI later from the
agent pane. Several sections below also use `winget` as the recommended manual
install method.

### Check whether winget is already installed

Open any PowerShell or Command Prompt window and run:

```powershell
winget --version
```

If a version number is printed (for example, `v1.8.1911`), you are done —
skip to the next section.

### Install winget from the Microsoft Store

If the command is not recognized, install the **App Installer** package from
the Microsoft Store:

> [Install App Installer (winget) from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4nns1)

After the Store finishes installing, close and reopen your terminal so the
new `winget.exe` is picked up on `PATH`, then verify with
`winget --version` again.

> [!TIP]
> WinGet ships in-box on Windows 11 and on modern Windows 10 builds. If the
> Microsoft Store link above does not work — for example, on a locked-down
> or Store-disabled machine — you have two fallbacks:
>
> - **Sideload the latest release from GitHub.** Download the
>   `Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_*.msixbundle` from the
>   [winget-cli releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/latest)
>   and install it with
>   `Add-AppxPackage -Path .\Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_*.msixbundle`.
>   The same page lists the prerequisite VC++ and UI XAML packages if your
>   machine is missing them.
> - **Ask your IT administrator** to deploy the
>   **Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller** package via Intune, Configuration
>   Manager, or Group Policy.

---

## 2. Node.js LTS — shared prerequisite

**Why you need it:** Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini CLI are all
distributed as npm packages. Intelligent Terminal also launches Claude and
Codex through `npx` wrappers
(`npx -y @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.65.0` and
`npx -y @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.13`), which require a working Node.js +
`npm` + `npx` toolchain on `PATH`. You can skip this section if you only
plan to use GitHub Copilot CLI.

### Check whether Node.js is already installed

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

Both commands should print a version number. Intelligent Terminal targets
whichever version `winget` installs from the **OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS** package
(i.e. the current Node.js LTS line).

### Install Node.js LTS with winget

```powershell
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS --exact --silent `
  --source winget `
  --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements `
  --disable-interactivity
```

This matches the command the Intelligent Terminal first-run experience runs
when it detects that Node.js is missing — you only need to run it manually
if you are setting up a machine outside the FRE flow. After the install
finishes, close and reopen your terminal so `PATH` picks up `node.exe`,
`npm.cmd`, and `npx.cmd`.

---

## Agent CLIs

Intelligent Terminal supports six agents out of the box — **GitHub
Copilot**, **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Gemini**, **OpenCode**, and **Antigravity**. The
agent pane can install **GitHub Copilot** (the default) after the FRE;
the others are **bring-your-own** — install the CLI yourself
(sub-sections below) before selecting it.

Intelligent Terminal talks to all six through the
[**Agent Client Protocol (ACP)**](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents).
**Copilot**, **Gemini**, and **OpenCode** speak ACP natively, so no extra layer is
required. **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex** do not speak ACP directly
— Intelligent Terminal launches them through an `npx` wrapper that is
fetched on demand at run time, so its only prerequisite is Node.js.
Antigravity ships a separate native ACP server; neither it nor the native `agy`
CLI requires Node.js or a user-installed Python runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> **Bringing your own ACP agent.** Any CLI that speaks ACP can also be
> wired up from **Settings → AI Agents → Add custom agent**. Custom
> agents work in the agent pane today, but **session management** (the
> multi-session sidebar in the agent pane) is not yet supported for
> custom agents — the built-in agents above provide the supported
> session experience.

### 3.1 GitHub Copilot CLI

**Why you need it:** GitHub Copilot is the **default agent** in Intelligent
Terminal. It powers the agent pane, the `?<prompt>` command-palette delegation,
and the auto-fix workflow.

#### Install from the agent pane

When you complete the FRE with Copilot selected, Intelligent Terminal opens
the agent pane. If the Copilot CLI is missing, choose **Install** there.
The terminal remains usable while Copilot setup is incomplete or fails.
The installer runs:

```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.Copilot --exact --silent `
  --source winget `
  --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements `
  --disable-interactivity
```

Copilot speaks ACP natively, so no wrapper is required.

#### Install manually

You can instead run the `winget` command above yourself, then verify:

```powershell
copilot --version
```

If the command is not found, close and reopen your terminal so the new
install directory is added to `PATH`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After installing, you must sign in before the agent will respond. See
> [Section 3.5 — Signing in to your agent](#35-signing-in-to-your-agent).

---

### 3.2 Claude Code (bring your own)

**Status:** Supported, but **not installed by Intelligent Terminal**. You
must install Anthropic's Claude Code CLI yourself before selecting Claude
in the FRE. Intelligent Terminal launches Claude through the
`@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` npx wrapper.

#### Step 3.2.1 — Install Node.js

Complete [Section 2 — Node.js LTS](#2-nodejs-lts--shared-prerequisite)
first. Claude Code is an npm package and cannot run without Node.js. If you
have not yet installed Node.js, the FRE will install it for you the first
time you select Claude.

#### Step 3.2.2 — Install the Claude Code CLI

```powershell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Verify:

```powershell
claude --version
```

#### Step 3.2.3 — ACP wrapper (no install action required)

Claude Code does not speak the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) directly, so
Intelligent Terminal launches it through the
[`@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp)
wrapper. The wrapper is fetched on demand at run time with:

```powershell
npx -y @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.65.0
```

You do **not** need to install anything for this — the only prerequisite
is a working Node.js + `npx` (which you already installed in Step 3.2.1).
The first launch may take a few seconds while `npx` downloads the wrapper.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After installing, you must sign in before the agent will respond. See
> [Section 3.5 — Signing in to your agent](#35-signing-in-to-your-agent).

---

### 3.3 OpenAI Codex (bring your own)

**Status:** Supported, but **not installed by Intelligent Terminal**. You
must install OpenAI's Codex CLI yourself before selecting Codex in the FRE.
Intelligent Terminal launches Codex through the
`@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` npx wrapper.

#### Step 3.3.1 — Install Node.js

Complete [Section 2 — Node.js LTS](#2-nodejs-lts--shared-prerequisite)
first. Codex is an npm package and cannot run without Node.js. If you have
not yet installed Node.js, the FRE will install it for you the first time
you select Codex.

#### Step 3.3.2 — Install the Codex CLI

```powershell
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Verify:

```powershell
codex --version
```

#### Step 3.3.3 — ACP wrapper (no install action required)

Codex does not speak the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) directly, so
Intelligent Terminal launches it through the
[`@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp)
wrapper. The wrapper is fetched on demand at run time with:

```powershell
npx -y @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.1.13
```

You do **not** need to install anything for this — the only prerequisite
is a working Node.js + `npx` (which you already installed in Step 3.3.1).
The first launch may take a few seconds while `npx` downloads the wrapper.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After installing, you must sign in before the agent will respond. See
> [Section 3.5 — Signing in to your agent](#35-signing-in-to-your-agent).

---

### 3.4 Gemini CLI (bring your own)

**Status:** Supported, but **not installed by Intelligent Terminal**. You
must install Google's Gemini CLI yourself before selecting Gemini in the
FRE. Gemini speaks the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) natively, so no
wrapper is required at runtime, but the CLI itself is still distributed as
an npm package.

#### Step 3.4.1 — Install Node.js

Complete [Section 2 — Node.js LTS](#2-nodejs-lts--shared-prerequisite)
first.

#### Step 3.4.2 — Install the Gemini CLI

```powershell
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

Verify:

```powershell
gemini --version
```

Gemini speaks ACP natively, so no wrapper is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Gemini requires you to sign in with your Google account before it will
> respond. See [Section 3.5 — Signing in to your agent](#35-signing-in-to-your-agent).

---

### Google Antigravity ACP (Windows and WSL)

Antigravity's ACP server is distributed separately from the interactive `agy` CLI.
Download the platform-specific `antigravity-acp` archive from the
[official ACP Registry](https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json).
The integration uses the standalone server's stdio protocol; do not substitute
`agy`, `agy -p`, or an invented `agy --acp` invocation.

| Execution source | Files to keep together | Native ACP command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `agy_acp_server.exe`, `localharness_external.exe` | `agy_acp_server.exe` |
| WSL Linux | `agy_acp_server.par`, `localharness_external` | `agy_acp_server.par --uid=` |

Extract the complete archive and add its directory to the selected source's `PATH`.
On Linux, make both files executable. Preserve the empty `--uid=` argument.
Discovery requires the matching companion beside the resolved server. An incomplete
installation earlier on `PATH` is not bypassed in favor of a later complete one.
Install the Linux archive inside the intended distro; a Windows executable exposed
through WSL interop is not a Linux ACP installation.

For a Windows agent pane, select **Google Antigravity** in agent settings. For WSL,
open that distro's profile settings and select its Antigravity backend. Authentication
is offered through ACP in the agent pane: select **Sign in**, choose a method
advertised by the server, and complete any browser authorization while the pane
is waiting. The server remains alive and Terminal establishes the authenticated
session after authorization. The waiting page also displays the current sign-in
link: press **O** to open it again or **Y** to copy the complete link into a
browser yourself. If automatic browser launch fails, authorization continues
waiting and the manual link remains available. Press **Esc** to cancel waiting; this does not log
out the provider or revoke authorization already completed. Do not copy credentials
between Windows and Linux or between Linux users.

The WSL runtime must be visible in the selected distro's default user's login
environment. Files installed for another user can exist while discovery cannot
find them. Check that user's `bash -lc` PATH and profile syntax rather than
switching to root or entering an ACP path as a custom agent. After correcting the
environment, reopen the profile settings so discovery runs again.

Signing in to the independent interactive `agy` CLI does not select an ACP
authentication method. Do not run an invented `agy --acp` or manually submit
JSON-RPC to complete normal product onboarding.

Model selection and native permission modes use the options advertised by the
connected ACP session. Intelligent Terminal's shared BYOK configuration is not
supported for Antigravity; provider-specific API-key authentication offered by ACP
is a separate capability. Usage displays only standard ACP fields when reported,
not inferred quota or subscription balances.

Install and authenticate the separate [official `agy` CLI](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/install)
for interactive delegation and shell-session tracking. Delegation uses
`agy -i "<prompt>"` and remains interactive after the initial response. Known CLI
sessions resume with `agy --conversation "<id>"`; a configured delegate model uses
the CLI's `--model` option, never an ACP server flag.

The CLI and ACP server have separate default conversation stores. The ACP server's
`session/list` does not expose CLI history, including when tested in an isolated
process pointed at the CLI home. Cold-start discovery of earlier CLI history is
therefore not available; hooks track live CLI sessions, and known-session/saved-layout
resume remains source-aware. Do not copy credentials or globally change provider
homes to make the stores appear interchangeable.
Picker resume follows the CLI's model selection behavior rather than reapplying a
one-off delegate model override. WSL backends currently identify a distro and use
its default user; an independent per-session Linux user is not part of the source
setting.

For Windows hooks, enable Sessions and run `wta hooks install --cli antigravity`.
The managed plugin uses `~/.gemini/config/plugins/wt-agent-hooks`; installation,
repair and version updates use `agy plugin install`. Removal uses the native
`agy plugin uninstall` command and verifies its result. If `agy` is absent,
Intelligent Terminal refuses to rewrite the provider's shared metadata and reports
that the native CLI is required; managed files are not silently discarded.

Windows hook reconciliation does not install inside a WSL distro. In that distro,
run `agy plugin install "<Linux path to the installed Terminal package>/wt-agent-hooks/antigravity-wsl"`
and restart the CLI; `agy plugin uninstall wt-agent-hooks` removes that in-distro
installation. The packaged bridge uses Windows PowerShell and `wtcli.exe` through
WSL interoperability, which must be enabled and resolvable from the Terminal shell.
The WSL command forwards the distro through child-scoped `WSLENV`, so tracking
does not depend on an interactive Bash prompt having emitted shell metadata.
Provider workspace roots can be empty, and hooks may run in the plugin directory.
The bridge instead uses the owning pane's reported or known launch directory,
including a WSL `--cd` directory, for session tracking and resume.
Only CLI transcript callbacks are forwarded; shared ACP processes and other
Antigravity frontends do not create duplicate shell-session rows.

Antigravity has no dedicated session-start, session-end or notification hook in
the exercised API. Tracking starts at `PreInvocation`, tools update activity,
`Stop` reports idle only when `fullyIdle` is true, and shell/pane lifecycle detects
exit. Permission-wait status is limited to callbacks the provider actually emits.

If a machine's application-control policy prevents a native server from starting,
use an administrator-approved runtime/environment rather than weakening the policy.
Windows and WSL installations are independent; a working Linux server does not
prove that the native Windows executable can start on that machine.

### 3.5 Signing in to your agent

Installing an agent's CLI is not enough — you must also sign in before
Intelligent Terminal can talk to it. Pick the row for the agent you
installed:

| Agent             | Sign-in command                                            | Official docs |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| GitHub Copilot    | `copilot login`                                            | [GitHub Copilot CLI docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-in-the-cli) |
| Claude Code       | `claude login`                                             | [Claude Code setup](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) |
| OpenAI Codex      | `codex auth` *(or set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable)* | [OpenAI Codex CLI docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) |
| Gemini CLI        | Run `gemini` once — it opens a browser to sign in with your Google account *(or set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable)* | [Gemini CLI authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/authentication.md) |
| Google Antigravity ACP | Use the authentication method offered in the agent pane; no external `agy login` command is generated | [Antigravity documentation](https://antigravity.google/docs/ide/extensions) |

After an external CLI sign-in, retry the agent connection so it picks up the
credentials. For authentication initiated in the agent pane, keep that pane
open: it completes the existing connection after authorization, with no
Terminal restart required.

---

### 3.6 Agent hooks for session management

**Why you need it:** Intelligent Terminal's **session management** feature
— the multi-session sidebar in the agent pane that lets you switch between
parallel conversations on the same tab — is powered by a small bundle of
**agent hooks** (`wt-agent-hooks`) that the agent CLI loads as a plugin /
extension. The first-run experience installs these hooks for you the
first time you save the FRE with **Session management** enabled. FRE installs
only the selected agent's hooks. After FRE, Intelligent Terminal automatically
reconciles hooks at `wta-master` startup, when Session management changes from
off to on, and when you select a different built-in agent.

You only need to follow this section if:

- The FRE reported that hooks installation failed (for example because
  the agent CLI was not yet on `PATH`, or your network blocked the agent
  CLI's plugin store).
- Automatic reconciliation failed and you need to repair the installation
  manually.

#### Step 3.6.1 — Make sure the agent CLI is installed and on PATH

The hooks are registered through the agent CLI's own plugin / extension
system, so the CLI itself must be installed first. Complete the matching
sub-section above before continuing:

- **GitHub Copilot** → [Section 3.1](#31-github-copilot-cli)
- **Claude Code** → [Section 3.2](#32-claude-code-bring-your-own)
- **OpenAI Codex** → [Section 3.3](#33-openai-codex-bring-your-own)
- **Gemini CLI** → [Section 3.4](#34-gemini-cli-bring-your-own)
- **OpenCode** → install and authenticate the CLI using the [OpenCode documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/)

Verify the CLI you intend to use prints a version number, then close and
reopen your terminal so any new install directory is on `PATH`.

#### Step 3.6.2 — Let Intelligent Terminal reconcile hooks

Open a **new** Intelligent Terminal window so `wta-master` and the agent CLI
pick up the current `PATH`. In **Settings → AI Agents**, turn **Sessions** on
and select the installed built-in agent. Intelligent Terminal
checks the agent asynchronously and installs missing hooks or upgrades stale
ones.

If automatic reconciliation fails, `wta hooks install` remains the supported
manual retry command. It applies the same smart reconciliation used by
automatic triggers:

```powershell
wta hooks install --cli copilot
wta hooks install --cli claude
wta hooks install --cli codex
wta hooks install --cli gemini
wta hooks install --cli opencode
wta hooks install --cli antigravity
```

Or install for every agent CLI that is currently on `PATH` in one go:

```powershell
wta hooks install
```

When reconciliation selects Install, it runs the agent CLI's native plugin /
extension command against the `wt-agent-hooks` bundle shipped inside the
Intelligent Terminal package:

| Agent          | Native commands invoked by `wta hooks install`                                                                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot plugin marketplace add <bundle>\copilot` then `copilot plugin install wt-agent-hooks@wt-local`                     |
| Claude Code    | `claude plugin marketplace add <bundle>\claude` then `claude plugin install wt-agent-hooks@wt-local`                        |
| OpenAI Codex   | `codex plugin marketplace add <bundle>\codex` then `codex plugin add wt-agent-hooks@wt-local` *(note: `add`, not `install`)* |
| Gemini CLI     | `gemini extensions install <bundle>\gemini-extension --consent --skip-settings` *(with `GEMINI_CLI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` to bypass Gemini's folder-trust prompt)* |
| OpenCode       | Copies the bundled plugin to `%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%\opencode\plugins\wt-agent-hooks.js` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set; otherwise it uses `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\plugins\wt-agent-hooks.js`, without modifying `opencode.json` |
| Antigravity    | `agy plugin install <staged-bundle>`; repairs enablement with `agy plugin enable wt-agent-hooks` when needed |

For OpenCode, the plugin is globally discoverable but emits events only from
interactive sessions running inside Intelligent Terminal. OpenCode ACP
processes used by the agent pane remain tracked through ACP, preventing
duplicate session rows. The installer will not overwrite a same-name plugin
file unless it carries Intelligent Terminal's managed-file marker.

You do not need to run these directly — `wta hooks install` is the
supported entry point and handles bundle staging, idempotency, and
diagnostic logging for you.

If status looks healthy but the hooks still do not run, use the explicit
force-recovery path:

```powershell
wta hooks install --force --cli codex
```

`--force` reruns the first-install flow even when the hook bridge already
appears installed. Close running sessions for that agent first so its plugin
manager cannot overwrite the registration while it is being repaired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Codex needs a one-time `/hooks` trust step.** After
> `wta hooks install --cli codex` succeeds, hook events will not fire
> until you launch Codex once and run the `/hooks` slash command to
> trust the `wt-agent-hooks` plugin. This is a Codex security
> requirement that no external installer can satisfy on your behalf;
> the other four CLIs do not need this step.

#### Step 3.6.3 — Verify the install

Check the status report to confirm each agent CLI is wired up:

```powershell
wta hooks status
```

You should see `installed` for the agent you selected, followed by the
installed hook version (for example `v0.1.5`). When a CLI's hooks were
registered by a different build, the row also names the version this
Intelligent Terminal ships — `v0.1.4 (bundle v0.1.5)` means the CLI is
loading older hooks and should be reinstalled with `wta hooks install`.
If Session management is off, turn it on to retry automatic reconciliation.

> [!TIP]
> If `wta hooks install` still fails, diagnostics are written to
> `wta-install-hooks*.log` under the Intelligent Terminal package's log
> directory. This is normally `wta-install-hooks.<UTC-date>.log`; the fixed
> `wta-install-hooks.log` name is used if daily logging cannot initialize.
>
> ```text
> %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\<PackageFamilyName>\LocalCache\Local\IntelligentTerminal\logs\<version>\wta-install-hooks*.log
> ```
>
> The most common causes of failure are: the agent CLI was not on
> `PATH` when `wta` ran (open a fresh window and retry), or the agent
> CLI has not been signed in yet (see
> [Section 3.5](#35-signing-in-to-your-agent)). The log identifies
> which step failed and prints the exit code from the underlying
> `plugin install` / `plugin add` / `extensions install` invocation.

> [!WARNING]
> If your organization disables agent session hooks through Group
> Policy, the **Session management** toggle in the FRE and in
> **Settings → AI Agents** is locked off and neither FRE nor automatic
> reconciliation will run the hooks installer. Contact your IT administrator
> if you believe this is in error.

## 4. Shell integration

**Why you need it:** Shell integration teaches your shell to emit **OSC 133**
marks after every prompt. Intelligent Terminal uses these marks to detect
command boundaries and exit codes, which powers the auto-fix feature, command
navigation, and the bottom-bar agent state. Without these marks Intelligent
Terminal cannot tell when a command finished or whether it failed.

The first-run experience installs shell integration automatically for every
**supported shell it detects** on your system — you usually don't have to do
anything. This section documents which shells are supported and the only
manual step you may occasionally need (adjusting the PowerShell execution
policy).

### What's supported

| Shell | Supported | Where integration is installed |

### 4.1 PowerShell

The first-run experience writes the shell-integration profile snippet for you,
for both **PowerShell 7+** (`pwsh.exe`) and **Windows PowerShell 5.1**
(`powershell.exe`). The snippet is appended to each host's
**current-user / current-host profile** — the same file `$PROFILE` (also
known as `$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost`) points at when you run that
host:

| PowerShell host | Profile path |
|---|---|
| PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh.exe`) | `$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` |
| Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`) | `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` |

You can always resolve the exact location from inside either host with:

```powershell
$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost
```

During the first-run experience, Intelligent Terminal automatically changes a
blocking CurrentUser execution policy to `RemoteSigned` before installing shell
integration. If an organization policy overrides that setting, or automatic
remediation otherwise fails, use the following steps.

#### Set the PowerShell execution policy

Shell-integration scripts are PowerShell `.ps1` files loaded from your
profile. PowerShell will refuse to run them under the default `Restricted`
or `AllSigned` execution policies. Lower the policy for the current user
to **at least** `RemoteSigned`:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to run this command in **both** hosts:
>
> - **PowerShell 7+** (`pwsh.exe`)
> - **Windows PowerShell 5.1** (`powershell.exe`)

`RemoteSigned` allows local scripts (such as your profile) to run while
still requiring a signature on scripts downloaded from the internet, which
is the recommended Microsoft default for developer machines.

> [!TIP]
> **Symptom that tells you this is the problem.** When a new
> PowerShell session starts, you see an error similar to:
>
> ```text
> . : File <path>\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loaded
> because running scripts is disabled on this system.
> ...
>     + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
>     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
> ```
>
> The key phrases to search for are **"running scripts is disabled on this
> system"** and **`UnauthorizedAccess`** — both indicate the execution
> policy is blocking your profile, and the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command
> above is the fix.

> [!WARNING]
> If your organization enforces execution policy through Group Policy,
> `Set-ExecutionPolicy` will succeed but the policy will not change.
> Contact your IT administrator if `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List` still
> shows `Restricted` or `AllSigned` for your scope after running the
> command above.

### 4.2 Bash (Git Bash)

For **Git Bash on Windows**, the first-run experience installs a small,
versioned script under `~/.intelligent-terminal/` (resolved from your
`%USERPROFILE%`) and sources it from a guarded block appended to **`~/.bashrc`**:

| What | Path |
|---|---|
| Integration script | `%USERPROFILE%\.intelligent-terminal\shell-integration_v1.sh` |
| Sourced from | `%USERPROFILE%\.bashrc` |

There is **no execution-policy equivalent** for bash, so no manual step is
normally required. A few notes:

- The script targets **bash 3.2+** and is safe to source multiple times. It
  silently no-ops in non-interactive shells and in non-bash shells, so a
  `.bashrc` that roams (via dotfiles / OneDrive) to a machine without
  Intelligent Terminal won't break.
- To uninstall, remove the Intelligent Terminal block from `~/.bashrc`. The
  versioned script files under `~/.intelligent-terminal/` are intentionally
  left in place to support side-by-side rollback; delete that directory by
  hand if you want a full sweep.

### 4.3 WSL bash

For **WSL** distributions, integration is installed **per distro** using the
same bash script as above, written through the distro's `\\wsl$\` UNC mount:

| What | Path |
|---|---|
| Integration script | `\\wsl$\<distro>\<home>\.intelligent-terminal\shell-integration_v1.sh` |
| Sourced from | `\\wsl$\<distro>\<home>\.bashrc` |

Notes and limitations:

- The `\\wsl$\` mount requires **Windows 10 1903 (build 18362)+**, which every
  supported Intelligent Terminal host meets. The first access auto-starts the
  distro, so the very first install pays a one-time VM cold-start cost.
- Only distros whose **login shell is bash** are covered (integration is
  written to `~/.bashrc`). Distros that default to — or where you have
  changed your default shell to — **zsh, fish, or another non-bash shell**,
  or that ship **without bash** (for example, Alpine), are **not yet
  supported**.

### Enable auto-error detection and auto-error fix

Once shell integration is in place, open **Settings → AI Agents** inside
Intelligent Terminal and turn on **Auto-error detection** (and, optionally, the
auto-fix follow-up). With shell integration loading correctly, the agent pane
will now:

- Detect failing commands automatically (via the OSC 133 exit-code marks).
- Offer to diagnose and propose a fix for the most recent failure.

If anything is not behaving as expected, see Microsoft's

and per-shell troubleshooting.
