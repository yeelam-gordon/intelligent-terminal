// Process-scope singleton for the wta-master half of the helper +
// master architecture. One wta-master process per Terminal process,
// spawned lazily on the first agent-pane request, contained in a
// Job Object with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE so it dies with Terminal.
//
// See doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md for the full design.
//
// This class only owns the master's *process lifecycle* and the
// allocation of the master ↔ helpers named pipe path. Helpers are
// spawned by TerminalPage as ordinary conpty children (legacy
// ConptyConnection path) and connect to the master via the pipe
// whose name `MasterPipeName()` exposes.
//
// Lifecycle model: reference-counted. Each agent pane calls
// `AcquirePane` on creation and `ReleasePane` when it closes. The
// first acquire spawns the master; the last release terminates it
// via the Job Object. master crashes are detected via
// RegisterWaitForSingleObject; state clears so the next acquire
// respawns cleanly, reusing the same pipe name so previously-spawned
// helpers can reconnect.
